term	definition
Abbreviated new drug application (ANDA)	A submission to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the review and potential approval of a generic drug product. Once an ANDA has been approved, applicants can manufacture and market a generic product. Applications are “abbreviated” as they do not need to include the detailed evidence required for a new drug application (NDA). Rather, applicants must demonstrate their product is bioequivalent to a licensed drug (i.e. it has the same properties and acts in the same way as a licensed drug).
Absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination (ADME)	The key factors affecting the concentration and distribution of a drug within the body and the time it spends in the body. Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. How a drug is absorbed, distributed across different tissues (or ‘compartments’), metabolized and eliminated (e.g. excreted) will all affect its ability to access its target site and have a biological effect. ADME are the core elements of pharmacokinetics.
Acinetobacter	Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative non-glucose-fermenting opportunistic bacterium typically a cause of hospital-acquired infections. A. baumannii can cause a wide range of infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, skin and soft tissue infections. It has evolved several properties that enable it to thrive and spread in healthcare settings, particularly high adherence to surfaces and the ability to survive in harsh environmental conditions. A. baumannii is highly adept at acquiring new antibiotic resistance genes. Over recent decades, it has acquired resistance to multiple antibiotics, including carbapenems. It is one of the ‘ESKAPE’ pathogens, the most common multidrug-resistant bacteria, and is categorized by WHO as a ‘priority 1 (critical)’ pathogen for R&D of new antibiotics.
Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)	The chemical component of a drug treatment that is biologically active. In addition to an API, drug formulations may include a range of other biologically inactive materials, for example, to promote stability or to facilitate the manufacture of tablets or liquid medicines.
Adaptive trial	A clinical trial that can be modified mid-way through based on preliminary analysis of results. Adaptive trials are efficient ways of testing more than one drug at a time, or different doses of a drug. If initial data suggest that a treatment is not working, or is inferior to a comparator, recruitment into that treatment arm can be halted. Adaptive trials were pioneered in oncology but are increasingly being used in other areas of medicine.
Aerobic bacteria	Bacteria that can survive and grow in an oxygenated environment. Aerobic infections are the most common causes of infections in humans, animals and plants. An anaerobic organism does not require oxygen for growth.
Ames test	A method for evaluating the mutagenic effects of a compound or drug, used as part of toxicity testing. The test chemical is applied to a bacterial strain that has a mutation which renders it dependent on histidine for growth, along with a rat liver extract (to explore the potential for enzymatic processing of the chemical into a mutagenic form). After culture, the number of colonies that can grow in the absence of histidine, due to reversion of the mutation, provides a measure of the mutagenic potential of the chemical. There is a reasonable degree of correlation between mutagenicity as judged by the Ames essay and carcinogenicity in animal models. However, it is a screening tool with limited predictability when used without other assays.
Anaerobic bacteria	"Bacteria that do not require oxygen for growth. A facultative anaerobic organism can grow without oxygen when necessary but uses oxygen when it is present. Obligate anaerobic organisms cannot use oxygen for growth; they are tolerant to oxygen to varying degrees. Anaerobic bacteria can cause infections at multiple sites in the body, but aerobic bacteria cause infections more often at different body sites. Anaerobic bacteria are major components of the microbial flora of multiple mucosal sites in the body, particularly the gastrointestinal tract, causing disease when mucosal barriers are breached. They are typically harder to culture and the cause of infections can be difficult to identify. Patients undergoing abdominal surgery often receive anti-anaerobe drugs to prevent peritoneal infections."
Antibiotic, antibacterial and antimicrobial	Antibiotic: A compound that inhibits the growth or kills bacteria. In recent years, ‘antibiotic’ has become synonymous with ‘antibacterial’. Antibacterial: A drug, chemical or other substance that kills bacteria (bactericidal) or stops their growth (bacteriostatic). Antimicrobial: A drug, chemical or other substance that kills, inactivates or slows the growth of microbes, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)	Lack of susceptibility of bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites to antimicrobial agents.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), resistance testing	Assessing the concentration of a drug, chemical or other substance required to inhibit microbial growth or to kill a microbe. Through bodies such as the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), internationally agreed standards have been developed to guide rigorous assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility.
Antiseptic	Noun: A substance that is applied to living tissue/skin to prevent the growth of disease-causing microorganisms. Adjective: Having antibacterial properties.
APACHE II score	The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score is the most widely used intensive care unit (ICU) mortality prediction score. The APACHE II score is made up of 12 physiological and two disease-related variables collected within the first 24 hours of ICU admission. Updated APACHE scoring systems have been developed but APACHE II remains the most used.
Bacterial efflux	Bacterial efflux describes a process where molecules are pumped from inside bacterial cells to outside. This is done by molecular machines called efflux pumps. These are found in the membrane of bacterial cells and they are very important because they contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Many antibiotics work by getting inside bacterial cells where they interact with a specific target. Efflux pumps are able to physically pump those antibiotic molecules back out of the cell again which keeps the intracellular concentration below toxic levels meaning bacteria can survive at higher concentrations of the drug.
Bacterial target	A molecule in the bacterial cell that has a critical cellular function and can be altered or inhibited by an antimicrobial to negatively impact its’s growth or survival.
Bactericidal	Having the capacity to kill bacteria. Bactericidal capacity is dependent on the concentration and duration of exposure to the antibiotic. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the minimum concentration required to achieve (bacteriostatic) activity. The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) is the concentration required to achieve bactericidal activity.
Bacteriophage	"Viruses that infect and kill bacteria and have been identified as a possible alternative or complement to antibiotic treatment. Phage therapy is used in a small number of countries, and whilst single patient success has been reported, development of these treatments is challenging; multiple clinical trials are ongoing."
Bacteriostatic	Having the capacity to stop the growth of bacteria. When a bacteriostatic compound is removed, bacterial growth resumes either immediately or after a certain time. Some compounds may be bacteriostatic at low concentrations but kill bacteria (bactericidal) at higher concentrations.
Best available therapy (BAT)	The most appropriate or best available treatment based on current scientific evidence. Also known as standard of care (SOC). In clinical trials, best available therapy is commonly used as the comparator against which new interventions are evaluated.
Beta (ß)-lactamase	Bacterial enzyme that hydrolyses and inactivates beta-lactam antibiotics, leading to antibiotic resistance. Beta-lactamases target the four-atom beta-lactam ring found in beta-lactam antibiotics. In the most used classification system, Ambler classification, beta-lactamases are grouped into four classes (A–D) based on amino acid sequence homologies. Ambler class A beta-lactamases include enzymes that are active on extended-spectrum cephalosporins (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ESBLs). Ambler class B enzymes rely on zinc for their activity and are also known as metallo-beta-lactamases. Ambler class D beta-lactamases were originally known as oxacillinases, owing to their rapid action on oxacillin, and are also known as OXA beta-lactamases. OXA enzymes have emerged as an important cause of carbapenem resistance, initially in Acinetobacter baumannii. OXA-type ESBLs have since spread to other bacterial families, including Enterobacteriaceae.
Beta (ß)-lactamase inhibitor (BLI)	Agents that inhibit the activity of bacterial beta-lactamases, enzymes that hydrolyse and inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics and are a common cause of antibiotic resistance. To protect the beta-lactam antibiotic from inactivation, beta-lactamase inhibitors are used in combination with a beta-lactam drug (BL–BLI combinations). Examples of beta-lactamase inhibitors include clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam and avibactam.
Biocide	A chemical used to kill a microorganism on a surface e.g., skin, hospital environment or a kitchen. Biocides include antimicrobials and are widely used as disinfectants and antiseptics. Biocides typically have more than one molecular target. Bacteria can develop reduced sensitivity to biocides and for some such as triclosan this leads to reduced susceptibility to antibiotics.
Biologics license application (BLA)	A request to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for permission to market a new biologic product. Formally, a BLA is defined as a request for “permission to introduce, or deliver for introduction, a biologic product into interstate commerce in the US”. A BLA is broadly equivalent to a new drug application (NDA) for traditional small-molecule drugs. It should contain all the information needed to demonstrate the product’s safety, potency and purity.
Bloodstream infection (BSI)	An infection of the blood that is circulated around the body. Blood is normally a sterile environment. Microbes from other parts of the body or the external environment can gain access to and multiply within blood. Bloodstream infections can be life threatening. An immune response to bacteria in the bloodstream can lead to sepsis, characterized by fever and low blood pressure, and if untreated multiple organ failure and death. Bloodstream infections are e responsible for high levels of morbidity and mortality. Many different types of microorganisms can establish bloodstream infections, and there is considerable variation in causative microorganisms in different parts of the world. Invasive medical procedures increase the risk of bloodstream infections, and so are common hospital-acquired infections. Bloodstream infections may be caused by drug-resistant microorganisms, and rising numbers of Gram-negative bacterial bloodstream infections are of great concern as these can be difficult to treat.
Breakpoint concentration, clinical	"The concentration of antibiotic used to define whether an infection by a particular bacterial strain/isolate is likely to be treatable in a patient. Typically, these are defined as susceptible or resistant to an antibiotic. The definition of the term ‘intermediate’ depends on the reference method and should be checked before using. Clinical microbiology laboratories use susceptibility testing and clinical breakpoint concentration data to provide guidance to clinicians so they can choose the most appropriate antibacterial therapy and dosing. Clinical breakpoint concentrations are different from antimicrobial susceptibility tests, since they take into account what happens to an antibiotic within the body (pharmacokinetics), which will affect an antibiotic’s clinical efficacy. Breakpoint concentrations are established by reference groups such as the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). However, for some drugs, EUCAST and CLSI recommend different breakpoint concentrations; this affects whether clinical isolates are considered to be susceptible or resistant."
Candidate	A compound with strong therapeutic potential whose activity and specificity have been optimized. Hits obtained by high-throughput screening have potential to become antibiotic drugs. Their antibacterial properties must be confirmed, and their structure may need to be modified to maximize their activity or other properties that will make them suitable to be used as drugs. At the end of this process, the resulting compound is considered a ‘candidate’ and potentially suitable for clinical trials.
Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)	Species of the Enterobacteriaceae family of Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to carbapenem antibiotics. Such bacteria are often resistant to most other antibiotics too. Many CRE produce enzymes known as carbapenemases that inactivate carbapenems and other beta-lactam antibiotics. Clinically important carbapenemases include the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), the Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM), imipenemase (IMP) and oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48). CRE can infect almost any part of the body. They are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) in many settings. CRE are associated with high mortality and are considered among the most pressing public health challenges globally. They are categorized by WHO as a ‘priority 1 (critical)’ pathogen for R&D of new antibiotics.
Chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC)	"Chemistry, manufacturing and controls; also referred to as pharmaceutical quality/CMC. The term covers the various procedures used to assess the physical and chemical characteristics of drug products, and to ensure their quality and consistency during manufacturing. CMC data are an important part of submissions to regulatory authorities."
Clearance, renal	Removal of a substance from the body by the kidney and its excretion in urine. In pharmacologic terms, it is a pharmacokinetic measurement of the volume of plasma from which a substance is completely removed per unit time. Renal clearance is the principal route through which most drugs are removed from the body. Dosing of antibiotics may need to be adjusted in people with impaired renal function, as some antibiotics are toxic at high concentrations.
Clinical Development	Testing of a new drug or treatment in people. Early stages of drug discovery and development involve in vitro studies and work on animal models. After this preclinical phase, promising drugs enter clinical development, which typically involves three distinct phases of clinical trials: Phase 1: first use in human volunteers, to assess safety and pharmacokinetics Phase 2: first testing in patients, to check safety, provisional efficacy, and to test different doses Phase 3: efficacy testing in a larger number of patients
Clinical exposure-response (CER) relationship	The relationship between plasma/serum drug levels (exposure) and clinical efficacy (response) in patients. Establishing exposure-response relationships is important for determining the optimal dose and dosing intervals of a drug treatment, to achieve the best balance between drug efficacy and the risk of adverse events.
Clinical study report (CSR)	Comprehensive report of an individual study conducted in patients of any therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic agent. A CSR must include an explanation of critical design features of the study, methods and how the study was carried out, individual patient data, and details of analytical methods. The content of CSRs is specified in guideline E3 produced by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). They are submitted to regulatory authorities and ethics committees and are a key element of submissions for regulatory approval.
Cmax	The highest (peak) concentration of a drug in the bloodstream or other part of the body after drug administration. Cmax is a key pharmacokinetic measure and informs dosing schedules. Drug concentrations in the body need to be high enough over a sustained period for the drug to be effective but without causing significant side effects.
Compassionate use, clinical	Synonym: expanded access. Providing seriously ill patients with access outside of clinical trials to a new, unapproved drug when other treatment options have been exhausted or none is yet available. Regulatory authorities provide guidance outlining the circumstances when compassionate use can be considered and the procedures that should be followed.
Database lock (DBL)	Finalisation of information (data sets) obtained in a clinical trial. After data collection has been completed in a clinical study, including follow up of all participants, data quality and validation exercises are undertaken. After this, the database is “locked” so no further changes can be made to trial data. Data are then extracted from the database for analysis. Database lock is a crucial point in a clinical trial. It is intended to protect and maintain the integrity of trial data.
De-escalation	Change from a broad-spectrum antimicrobial to a narrower spectrum drug or change from combination therapy to monotherapy. Treatment of suspected serious life-threatening infections, such as bloodstream infections in patients with sepsis, is often started without confirmation of infection or identification of the organism responsible. This leads to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics. When microbiological diagnostic information becomes available, clinicians may be able to safely switch to more specific treatments and/or discontinue use of certain antibiotics. Antibiotic de-escalation is a key element of antimicrobial stewardship programmes. Reduced use of broad-spectrum or unnecessary antibiotics lowers the selection pressures that drive the development of resistance. It also reduces patients’ risk of adverse reactions to antibiotics. In practice, de-escalation can be challenging as clinicians may be reluctant to halt treatment if a patient seems to be responding.
Dosing: BID, TID	"BID: bis in die, twice a day; TID: ter in die: three times a day. The appropriate dosing regimen for a drug depends on exposure-response relationships and is based on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence. Depending on the drug class and its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, different dosing regimens may be optimal, including once a day (omne in die, OD), twice a day (bis in die, BID) or three times a day (ter in die, TID)."
Double-blind	A study in which neither the participants nor the experimenters know who is receiving the test treatment/s or placebo. The double-blind study design is used to minimize participant and researcher biases that could threaten the validity of a research study.
Drug product, medicinal product	The final form of a medicinal product, such as a tablet, pill or liquid medicine. A drug product includes an active pharmaceutical ingredient, often (but not always) in association with other active or inactive ingredients.
Efflux-mediated resistance	Resistance to antibiotics related to the presence of pumps that pump antibiotic molecules from the inside of the bacterial cell to the outside. Structurally and mechanistically diverse efflux pumps in the cell envelope play an important role in both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance.
Eligibility criteria (inclusion/exclusion)	Criteria used to determine who is eligible (or ineligible) for recruitment into a clinical study. Inclusion criteria are based on the condition(s) and populations that a study is focusing on, such as specific infections or age groups for antibiotic trials. Exclusion criteria are used to exclude potential participants, for example if they have additional conditions that could complicate interpretation of results, if use of an intervention might place them at risk, or if medications they are taking could interfere with the trial intervention.
Endpoint, clinical trial	The principal outcome that is measured in a clinical trial. Clinical trials typically assess multiple endpoints. The primary endpoint relates specifically to the anticipated clinical impact of an intervention, such as cure or survival, to provide a measure of its efficacy. Secondary endpoints can provide additional information on the effects of an intervention and on mechanisms of action, as well as on possible specific safety issues. Exploratory endpoints cover clinical outcomes likely to be rare or measures that allow hypotheses to be tested. It is essential that endpoints are selected that provide a reliable assessment of the benefits of an intervention and hence its efficacy. They must be acceptable to all stakeholders, particularly regulatory authorities, which must have confidence in the validity and reliability of endpoints to approve new treatments.
Enterobacterales	Order of diverse facultatively anaerobic and rod-shaped Gram-negative bacteria that includes many bacteria that infect people. The Enterobacterales order includes the families Enterobacteriaceae, Morganellaceae, Yersiniaceae, Erwiniaceae, Hafniaceae and others.
Enterobacteriaceae	A family of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, glucose-fermenting bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract. The most clinically relevant members of this family are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. Multidrug resistance is common among Enterobacteriaceae, with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) seen as a particular public health threat.
Enterococcus	A genus of Gram-positive bacteria that includes several bacteria that cause infections in people. Enterococci are ubiquitous coccoid Gram-positive bacteria that can also be pathogenic. The genus Enterococcus comprises several species, with E. faecalis and E. faecium being the most abundant enterococcal species in humans. Enterococci have adapted to survive in healthcare environments and are an important cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Such enterococci are considered to be a specific type or ‘clade’, distinct from commensal gut enterococci. Healthcare-associated enterococci are typically multidrug-resistant, with some isolates resistant to glycopeptides such as vancomycin (vancomycin-resistant enterococci, VRE). This can make treatment of these infections challenging.
Epidemiological cut-off value (ECOFF)	"Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are properties of drugs, not of a microbe. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic is the minimum concentration to inhibit the growth of a microorganism. Where the MIC value for a bacterial isolate is below the ECOFF, the bacterium is likely to be from a wild-type drug-susceptible population; where the MIC value is above the ECOFF the bacterium is likely to be resistant. ECOFF values are based on microbiological studies, and do not necessarily indicate whether a drug will be clinically active, since they do not take into account what happens to an antibiotic within the body (pharmacokinetics). ECOFF values are not the same as clinical breakpoint concentrations."
ESKAPE	A group of bacteria – Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp – that are the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections globally. Variations to ESKAPE exist, with ‘E’ standing for Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, or Enterobacterales. Clinically, these bacteria are important because they are common, often multidrug-resistant and difficult to treat.
Eukaryotic cell	A cell with a nucleus enclosed within a nuclear envelope and membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria. People have eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells are typically much larger than those of prokaryotic cells (e.g., bacteria), which lack a clearly defined nucleus.
Extensively drug-resistant (XDR)	Non-susceptibility to at least one agent in all but one or two antimicrobial categories (i.e. bacterial isolates remain susceptible to drugs from at most two classes of antibiotic). XDR organisms are resistant to more drugs than multidrug-resistant (MDR) microbes and often require use of relatively toxic drugs, high doses of drugs or drug combinations. Acquisition of additional resistance mechanisms has the potential to turn them into pandrug-resistant (PDR) organisms, resistant to all available antibiotics.
Fastidious bacteria	Microorganisms that are difficult to grow in the laboratory because they have complex or restricted nutritional and/or environmental requirements. Examples of fastidious bacteria include anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. They can be difficult to grow in the laboratory and can present challenges for determining antimicrobial sensitivity.
First-in-human	Synonym: first-in-man (FIM), First study of a novel intervention in humans. First-in-human studies are usually carried out in healthy volunteers. Their principal role is to assess the safety of new interventions. They may incorporate a dose-escalation study design (single ascending dose or SAD study) to identify the optimum dose for use in future trials. First-in-human studies are also used to gather data on the effects of a new drug in humans and how it is metabolized. First-in-human studies are phase 1 trials.
Good clinical practice	Internationally agreed ethical and scientific quality standards for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve human participants. Adherence to Good Clinical Practice ensures that the rights, safety, and wellbeing of participants are respected and protected, and that clinical trial data are reliable. Compliance with Good Clinical Practice is generally a legal obligation for all studies of investigational medical products involving human participants.
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)	A quality assurance system to ensure the uniformity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility, quality and integrity of data from non-clinical studies to be submitted to regulatory authorities. Compliance with Good Laboratory Practice standards is essential for laboratory data to be accepted by regulatory authorities in regulatory submissions.
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)	A quality assurance system for manufacturers to ensure that their products are consistently high in quality from batch to batch. Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines are designed to ensure the safety and activity of manufactured pharmaceutical products. Global standards have been developed by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and the World Health Organization. Enforcement is the responsibility of national regulatory authorities.
Gram-positive/negative	Characterization of bacteria according to their appearance after Gram staining, which reflects differences in the structure of their cell walls. The cell envelopes of most bacteria fall into one of two major groups. In addition to a cytoplasmic/inner membrane, Gram-negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan cell wall and an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide. Between the two membranes is the periplasm where enzymes such as beta-lactamases are found. Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer membrane but have a much thicker peptidoglycan layer than Gram-negative organisms. There is no periplasm and enzymes e.g., beta-lactamases are excreted to the outside of the cell. This distinction has important implications for antibiotic development. Many antibiotics target proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis so have to traverse the outer membrane and periplasm in Gram-negative bacteria. Hence, the complex cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria presents a significant barrier to the entry of antibiotics into the cell. Gram-negative bacteria include many multidrug-resistant species, including all three of the highest priorities in the WHO priority pathogen list for R&D of new antibiotics.
High-throughput screen (HTS)	The process by which large numbers of natural product extracts or chemicals (compound libraries) are tested for antimicrobial activity using automated and/or robotic equipment. High-throughput screens can either test the ability of compounds to inhibit a specific bacterial target or, more generally, to inhibit the growth of bacterial cells (see: ‘bacteriostatic‘) or kill bacteria (see: ‘bactericidal‘). Compounds discovered to have antibacterial activity in initial screens are known as ‘hits’.
Hit	A compound or extract identified in an initial screen for antibacterial activity. A hit must be re-tested to confirm its activity (see: ‘Hit confirmation, hit validation‘).
Hit confirmation, hit validation	Evaluation of a compound discovered to have antibacterial properties (a hit), by confirming its ability to inhibit bacterial growth, assessing its binding to molecular targets of interest, and determining its chemical structure. Hit validation is essential for eliminating false-positives from high-throughput screens, demonstrating that a compound has the potential to be an effective treatment, with no obvious chemical features that would make it difficult to develop into a drug.
Hit expansion	Chemical modification of an original hit obtained from screening to generate a suite of related derivatives. Although a hit has been found to have antibacterial activity, it may be a weak inhibitor or have other properties unfavourable to drug development. Chemical modifications may improve antibacterial activity or another important property such as solubility. Importantly, work on a family of related compounds can reveal which parts of the compound are most important to its antibacterial activity (structure-activity relationship). This information can guide further chemical modification to enhance its activity and specificity.
Hit identification, hit discovery	Testing for compounds that have antibacterial properties (hits), for example by high-throughput screening of compound libraries. Hits are an important starting point in drug discovery and development. However, they may require considerable chemical modification to enhance their antibacterial activity and other properties. Very few initial hits become antibiotics licensed to treat infections.
Hit-to-lead (HTL), lead generation	A stage of drug discovery during which a compound demonstrated to have antibacterial properties (a hit) is iteratively modified to improve its efficacy and other properties. Typically, multiple chemical variants of a hit compound are synthesized (hit expansion). Studies of these compounds help to identify key structural features of the compound associated with binding to molecular targets and efficacy (structure–activity relationships). Chemical modifications are also introduced to improve its drug-like properties, such as stability, membrane permeability, cytotoxicity and specificity. This stage ends with one or more optimized lead compounds that are extensively evaluated for efficacy and safety in biochemical and cellular assays and in animal studies.
Informed consent	Agreement from a potential participant that he or she is willing to take part in a clinical study and is aware of what the study involves. The principle of informed consent ensures that participants willingly take part in clinical studies and are fully aware of what the studies involve. To give informed consent, a potential participant must have received sufficient information in a format that enables them to understand the implications of their decision, and they must have sufficient reasoning powers to interpret the information provided. Special procedures are applied for those unable to give informed consent, for example, because of age, a decline in cognitive abilities or severe illness.
Institutional Review Board (IRB)	"A committee that reviews and approves the design of studies involving human participants. Before clinical trials are started, research plans must be reviewed and approved by a competent and appropriately constituted institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee (IEC), also known as a research ethics committee (REC). The role of IRBs is to protect the rights, interests and welfare of participants in clinical studies. IRBs typically also monitor studies and review projects to ensure that procedures are followed. IRB review is generally mandatory for clinical studies; some countries have national ethics committees that must also review and approve applications to carry out clinical research."
International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)	A global body that brings together regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry to discuss scientific and technical aspects of pharmaceutical development, approval and safety monitoring, and develops good practice guidelines. ICH guidelines cover quality, safety, efficacy and multidisciplinary issues. They are not mandatory but they do act as a set of generally accepted international standards.
Intra-abdominal infection (IAI)	A group of infections that occur within the abdominal cavity. IAIs are a common cause of gastrointestinal emergency procedures and responsible for high levels of morbidity and mortality. An uncomplicated IAI (uIAI) involves only a single organ and does not extend to the peritoneum, a two-layer membrane that lines the abdominal cavity. A complicated IAI (cIAI) involves more than one organ and infection of the peritoneal space, the gap between the two layers of the peritoneum, leading to abscesses or peritonitis. Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria can cause IAIs and these can be drug-resistant.
Intracellular concentration	Intracellular concentration describes the concentrations of a drug in a cell such as a bacterium, characterized by the penetration, distribution, degradation and efflux of drugs in individual cells. Antibiotics don’t distribute equally in all tissue compartments. β-lactam antibiotics, for example, hardly penetrate into intracellular compartments of the bacterial cell, while fluoroquinolones and macrolides may even accumulate intracellularly. Intracellular penetration is important for the therapy of intracellular pathogens such as Chlamydia, M. tuberculosis, Legionella, Salmonella typhi. The intracellular space has different intracellular compartments where bacteria and the drug may distribute differently.
Investigational medicinal product (IMP)	Any medicinal product that is being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial. IMPs include newly developed drugs but also licensed drugs that are being tested against a new condition, or in a new formulation or packaging, or are being used to gather more information about the authorised form. Regulatory authorities mandate specific procedures for manufacturing and handling of IMPs, to ensure their quality and safety and hence the validity of clinical trial data.
Investigational new drug (IND)	A novel drug, ready to be tested for safety and efficacy in people. Before a new drug or biological product can be tested on people in the USA, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application must be made to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). An IND application must include information on safety in animal models, on manufacturing processes and quality assurance (CMC), the design of the proposed clinical studies, and the qualifications of the investigators due to carry out the study. The IND process is designed to enable regulators to assess whether a drug is safe to test in humans and has promise as a potential treatment. In Europe, a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) must be made to national regulatory agencies to secure approval for studies on humans.
Investigator’s brochure (IB), clinical	A comprehensive document summarizing preclinical and clinical data relevant to the use of an investigational product (test drug) in human subjects. The IB is of critical importance throughout drug development and is continually updated. It provides the rationale for the planned use of an investigational product in a trial (such as dose and route of administration) and plans for participant monitoring and care. It is of particular importance for ensuring that investigators carrying out clinical studies can assess the risks and benefits associated with a new investigational drug and can deliver appropriate care to those who receive it. Maintenance of the IB is an aspect of Good Clinical Practice and is covered by International Council for Harmonization (ICH) and other guidelines.
Klebsiella	A genus of non-motile, aerobic and facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria. Klebsiella belongs to the Enterobacterales Enterobacteriaceae family. It is a common cause of both community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections, including pneumonia and respiratory tract infections. Klebsiella is one of the ‘ESKAPE’ pathogens that make up the most common antibiotic-resistant infections. Multidrug-resistant and extremely drug-resistant Klebsiella are among the most challenging infections to treat. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae such as Klebsiella are categorized by WHO as a ‘priority 1 (critical)’ pathogen for R&D of new antibiotics.
Lead compound	A promising newly discovered compound with antibacterial properties that has been selected for more intensive testing. Following screening for active compounds, those with antibacterial properties (hits) are chemically modified during the stages of hit confirmation and hit-to-lead to enhance their activity and drug-like properties. This typically generates a series of related compounds differing slightly in their chemical properties. The molecule with the most promising overall set of properties is selected as the lead compound for further detailed investigation.
Lead optimization	Modifying the chemical characteristics of a molecule to maximize its antimicrobial activity and improve its pharmacological properties. Lead optimization builds on hit expansion, focusing on lead compounds with the most promising properties. Modifications focus on key areas such as strengthening binding to bacterial target molecules, minimizing binding to host structures, which could cause side effects, and ensuring its availability within target tissues in the body. Lead optimization generates one or more candidates for clinical evaluation.
Limited population pathway for antimicrobial and antifungal drugs (LPAD)	A US regulatory pathway designed to accelerate the availability of new treatments for serious and life-threatening infections in a limited population of patients with unmet needs. For products approved through this pathway, product labelling and promotional material must make it clear the populations in which the product has been tested. Such materials must also highlight the greater uncertainty or higher risk that these patients face because of the accelerated appraisal process. LPAD was introduced in the 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law in 2016. In 2019, approval through this pathway was given for use of pretomanid to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis.
Lipophilicity	The tendency of a chemical to dissolve into fat (lipid) rather than water (aqueous) environments.
LogD	A measure of the preference of a compound to dissolve in either water or an organic solvent (such as octanol). More technically, it is the logarithm of the distribution coefficient (D) of a molecule between an aqueous and lipophilic phase, which takes into account the differential distribution of charged and uncharged forms of the molecule. Charged and non-charged forms of an ionizable compound partition differentially between water and an organic solvent. The distribution of the compound will therefore vary with pH, which alters the proportion of ionized molecules. LogD is therefore used to provide a measure of the lipophilicity of ionizable compounds. For non-ionizable compounds, logD is the same as logP across all pH values. Antibiotics with activity for Gram-negative bacteria often have a low LogD value.
LogP	A measure of the preference of a compound to dissolve in either water or an organic solvent (such as octanol) when uncharged. More technically, it is the logarithm of the partition coefficient (P) of a molecule between an aqueous and lipophilic phase. LogP therefore provides a measure of the lipophilicity of a molecule. Lipophilicity is a key characteristic of drug molecules, affecting their absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). High lipophilicity is often preferred in drug development, particularly for intracellular targets. However, the most desirable properties for an antibiotic will depend on multiple factors, including the site of infection and location of the drug’s molecular target. If a compound can be ionized, its logP value will vary with pH. For ionizable compounds, the related measure logD is used to characterize lipophilicity.
Marketing authorization application (MAA)	An application made to a European regulatory authority for approval to market a medicine within the European Union (or Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway). An MAA includes comprehensive information about a drug to enable a regulatory authority to judge its quality, safety and efficacy.
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)	The highest dose of a medicine or treatment that will produce the desired effect without resulting in unacceptable side effects. Higher concentrations of a drug are more likely to be effective but may induce side effects that deter use or outweigh the benefits of treatment. Maximum tolerated doses are usually determined in animal studies and provide the basis for choosing the range of drug concentrations tested in phase 1 trials (dose escalation).
Mechanism of action (MoA)	The specific biochemical interaction through which an antimicrobial produces its pharmacological effect. For antibiotics, the most common mechanisms of action are: Inhibition of cell wall synthesis Inhibition of protein synthesis Disruption of cell membranes Inhibition of DNA replication or transcription Inhibition of bacterial metabolism For compounds identified in phenotypic screens, mechanisms of action may not be immediately obvious. Further studies are required to understand how they achieve their antibacterial effects. Determining mechanism of action is important because it suggests what modifications could be made to a compound to improve its activity and specificity. In addition, antibiotics used as combinations should ideally have different mechanisms of actions, to make it harder for bacteria to develop resistance to treatment.
Median effective dose (ED50)	The dose of a medication that produces a specified effect in 50% of recipients. In antibacterial drug research and development (R&D), ED50 is a measure of efficacy, and is used to compare the efficacy of different compounds in preclinical animal models.
Median lethal dose (LD50)	The dose at which a substance is lethal for 50% of animals tested (usually mice). LD50 values provide a measure of the toxicity of a substance – the lower the LD50 value, the greater its toxicity.
Medicinal chemistry	The design, synthesis and modification of biologically active molecules. Medicinal chemistry plays a critical role in converting a newly discovered molecule with antibacterial activity (a hit) into a safe and effective candidate. Key steps include modifying the molecule to explore the relationship between chemical structure and antibacterial activity (structure-activity relationship, SAR) and adapting the molecule to improve its efficacy and drug-like properties (lead optimization).
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)	The lowest concentration of an antibiotic that prevents the visible growth of bacteria. Potent antibiotics, therefore, have low MIC values. As bacteria become less susceptible to an antibiotic, MIC values increase. To categorize microbes as drug-resistant, the MIC values are compared with standardized recommended breakpoint concentrations.
Multidrug-resistant (MDR)	Lack of susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more chemical classes of antibiotic (e.g. a beta-lactam, an aminoglycoside, a macrolide).
Mycobacterium tuberculosis	A small rod-shaped bacillus that grows very slowly and causes tuberculosis (TB). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) survives within human macrophages. It can establish very long-lasting infections, often without causing any symptoms (latent TB). Treatment of TB is highly challenging, requiring several antibiotics for several months. Mtb is slow growing and difficult to culture, and identification increasingly relies on molecular diagnostics. Although Mtb does not acquire antibiotic resistance through genetic exchange, some chromosomal mutations confer resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as rifampicin. Drug-resistant TB infections are a growing public health challenge. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), strains resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid, requires longer and more intensive antibiotic treatment, with high treatment failure rates. Extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is resistant to rifampicin, isoniazid, fluoroquinolones and at least one second-line drug (amikacin, capreomycin or kanamycin).
Natural products	"Natural products are small molecules produced by living organisms including plants, invertebrates and microorganisms. They are also known as secondary metabolites being non-essential for life; but they play key roles in defence and cell to cell communication. They represent a unique chemical space with compounds distributed in a broad diversity of chemical classes. They have been evolving with nature together with the activities that have been optimized together with the targets. Pharmaceutical companies have been using natural products for decades as one of the major sources for discovery of novel bio-active compounds and today more than 50% of the molecules in development are still natural products, semi-synthetic derivatives or have been inspired in these scaffolds. Today, natural products are still an untapped reservoir with more than 90% of the microbial sources still underexplored and with biosynthetic potential that by far exceeds the initial estimations. This is why natural products still represent one of the major sources of chemical diversity and one of the starting points for the discovery of novel antibiotics."
Neisseria gonorrhoeae	Gram-negative bacterium that causes gonorrhoea, an important and frequently multidrug-resistant sexually transmitted infection. Neisseria gonorrhoeae has progressively developed resistance to many different antibiotics. Cephalosporins are the only class of drug retaining efficacy against most N. gonorrhoeae. However, decreasing sensitivity has been observed to ceftriaxone, leading to treatment failures, and raising the prospect of untreatable infections. N. gonorrhoeae is classified as “high priority” on the WHO’s priority pathogens list for R&D of new antibiotics.
New chemical entity (NCE), new molecular entity (NME)	A novel compound that has not previously been approved for use in humans. NCE (or new drug substance in the EU) is a formal definition used by regulatory authorities, designed to give protection to the developers of new drugs during clinical evaluation phases of drug development. More informally, NCE is used to describe a newly developed drug compound, as opposed to the re-use of an existing drug for a different disease, re-formulation of an existing drug, or a novel combination of existing drugs. Development of new antibiotic treatments depends both on the discovery and development of NCEs.
New drug application (NDA)	The formal process through which a company or other body requests permission from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make and sell a drug in the USA. In Europe, the equivalent process is known as a marketing authorization application (MAA).
No observed adverse effect level (NOAEL)	Highest dose of a drug that does not produce a significant increase in adverse effects in comparison to a control group in clinical (human) or preclinical studies (animal). Calculating NOAELs is an important aspect of risk assessment in drug development. Determining NOAEL values informs the choice of dose used in clinical trials.
No observed effect level (NOEL)	Highest dose of a drug that has no observable impact distinguishable from those seen in controls. NOEL refers to any effect, but is commonly applied to adverse effects, in which case it is synonymous with NOAEL.
Non-fermenter	A taxonomically heterogeneous group of bacteria that cannot catabolize glucose and are thus unable to ferment. Examples of non-fermenting bacteria that cause infections in people are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Burkholderia pseudomallei. Ubiquitous in nature and highly adaptable, non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). These species are often multidrug-resistant.
Non-inferiority margin	A non-inferiority trial is used to test whether an antibiotic is not inferior to an existing product. Non-inferiority is confirmed if efficacy is shown to be no less than a pre-specified value, the non-inferiority margin. Determining an appropriate non-inferiority margin is challenging, and regulators have provided detailed guidance on how it should be calculated.
Non-inferiority trial	"A trial design aiming to assess whether a test product is not inferior to a comparator. Non-inferiority is defined as efficacy that is no lower than a small pre-specified value, known as the non-inferiority margin. This margin must be specified in advance and based on clinical and statistical data; choice of non-inferiority margin can be challenging, and regulatory agencies have published extensive guidance to inform trial design."
Number needed to treat (NNT)	The number of patients that need to be treated to prevent the health outcome of interest. The number needed to treat is used to provide a more intuitive picture of the efficacy or protective value of an intervention. It can be calculated using the formula NNT = 100/ARR, where ARR is the absolute risk reduction (the difference between event rates in control and intervention groups as a percentage). NNT can provide a more understandable picture of the benefit of an intervention than the commonly used relative risk reduction (RRR, the difference between events rates divided by the rate in the control group). For example, if an intervention reduces event rates from 20% to 10%, the RRR is 50%, the ARR is 10%, and the NNT is 10. However, if an intervention reduces event rates from 4% to 2%, the RRR is still 50%, but the ARR is 2%, and the NNT is 50.
Observational study	A clinical study that is used to gather data but does not involve the testing of an intervention (e.g., new drug). Observational studies are used to collect varying kinds of information, such as the prevalence of an infection, cause of an infection, use of particular drugs in clinical settings, the characteristics of affected patients, the care procedures used, and clinical outcomes for normal standard of care. The information gathered is typically used to identify patient populations and suitable sites for trials, and to guide the design of interventional studies, which assess the impact of interventions such as new drugs. Observational studies can be used to generate evidence of the efficacy of treatments, for example through case–control designs (where outcomes in cases are compared with those in matched individuals). Evidence from observational studies is generally not seen as reliable as that from randomised controlled trials.
Orphan drug	A drug developed to treat a rare (“orphan”) disease. Many diseases are so rare that it is not economically viable for companies to invest in the development of new treatments. Collectively, however, orphan diseases are responsible for a significant burden of disease. Regulatory authorities therefore provide incentives to encourage therapy development for orphan diseases. To qualify for orphan drug status, a therapy must be targeted at a condition affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the USA (about six in 10,000 people) or not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU. New antibiotics and other anti-infectives targeting rare but important infections can be granted orphan drug status (e.g. treatment of prosthetic joint infections, or treatment of lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis).
Outcome, clinical trial	Measurable changes in health monitored during a clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of an intervention. Outcomes can be either positive (e.g. cure, survival) or negative (e.g. death). Choice of outcome measure is a critical aspect of clinical trial design. They must provide a reliable and meaningful measure of the impact of an intervention. Ideally, they are widely accepted and used measures, facilitating pooled analysis of data from multiple studies. It is important to ensure that outcome measures are considered appropriate by regulatory authorities. Discussion with such authorities may be necessary in advance of trials to determine which outcome measures would be acceptable. Endpoints are specific outcome values, used to assess whether an intervention has had a clinically meaningful impact.
Pandrug-resistant (PDR)	Non-susceptibility to all agents in all antimicrobial categories (i.e. bacterial isolates are not susceptible to any clinically available drug). The prevalence of PDR bacteria is difficult to judge as isolates are rarely assessed against all possible antibiotics. However, PDR Gram-negative bacteria have been reported in more than 20 countries in all regions of the world. Mortality in patients infected with these bacteria is high (around 50% on average) but very variable.
Pharmacodynamics (PD)	Study of the uptake, movement, binding and interactions of drugs in the body and how they affect drug activity. Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. Any factor affecting drug concentration at its target site, strength of binding or duration of binding will affect that drug’s pharmacological activity and clinical responses. Broadly speaking, pharmacodynamics considers the properties of a drug that affect target engagement in the body, while pharmacokinetics considers the effect of the body on a drug.
Pharmacokinetics (PK)	Study of the body’s handling and metabolism of drugs in the body, including their absorption, distribution between different tissues, localization within tissues, modification and excretion (see: ‘ADME‘). Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. If the body does not absorb a drug, modifies it chemically, or rapidly excretes it, the drug will be less able to bind to its target site and have a biological effect. Broadly speaking, pharmacokinetics considers the effect of the body on a drug, while pharmacodynamics considers the properties of a drug that affect target engagement in the body. Population PK modelling takes account of variation in how drugs are metabolized by different people within a population. This requires more sophisticated statistical methodologies but provides results more relevant to individuals. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models are more closely based on human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry. They are complex multi-component models that more accurately reflect human biology but are also more challenging to develop.
Pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)	Integration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to understand how a drug is likely to be distributed through the body over time and the access it will have to its molecular target. This understanding provides the basis for dosing strategies. Typically, PK/PD modelling is used to simulate how a drug is distributed across different tissues (or ‘compartments’) over time. These models can be used to estimate drug concentrations at different body sites for different dosing regimens and drug effect.
Pharmacovigilance	Clinical trials are used to assess the safety of new medicines. Pharmacovigilance is the process of collecting safety data after the drug has been approved for use and giving this information to the regulatory authorities. The data collected includes adverse effects associated with use of a drug. Pharmacovigilance is required after marketing approval to detect potential adverse reactions that could be due to use of the medicine. In particular, it can detect rare side effects that are not picked up during clinical trials or affect specific groups of individuals. A phase 4 clinical trial investigates the occurrence of side effects over time by a new treatment after it has been approved and is on the market.
Phase 1, 2, 3, 4 trials	Different stages of clinical testing of a new drug. Phase 1: First testing in humans, primarily to test safety. A drug is given to a small number of healthy volunteers who are closely monitored. Phase 2: Testing in a small number of patients, to assess safety, to monitor how a drug is metabolized, and to gather initial data on efficacy. Phase 3: A large trial in patients to test efficacy and safety. Pivotal phase 3 trials (or registration trials) provide the key data on efficacy in submissions for regulatory approval. Phase 4: Studies undertaken after a drug has been licensed, to gather further safety, efficacy or effectiveness data in routine clinical use. Phase 2 studies are sometimes divided into phase 2A and 2B. There are no formal definitions of these divisions, but phase 2A studies are typically more preliminary and can address issues such as dosing and safety, while phase 2B studies are generally ‘mini-phase 3’ studies that provide data on efficacy. Increasingly, these categories are becoming less clear-cut, particularly phase 2 and 3 trials.
Placebo-controlled trial	A clinical trial in which patients are randomized to receive either an experimental drug or a placebo (a medicine with no active ingredients). Ideally, such trials are ‘double-blinded’ so that neither patients nor the person administering the drug know what is being given. Placebo-controlled trials are generally not done for antibiotics as this is considered unethical if alternative effective treatments already exist. Clinical trials of antibiotics usually compare a new drug with an existing drug or current standard of care.
Plasma concentration	Plasma concentration refers to the concentration of an agent in the plasma which is derived from full blood. Plasma concentrations are used to define major PK and PK/PD parameters. In most cases, they are good estimates for the distribution of an antibiotic and there is the added advantage of samples of blood being obtained easily. Routine plasma concentration measurements provide information about total blood concentrations and do not differentiate between the plasma protein-bound and free fraction of the drug concentration.
Plasma protein binding	Plasma protein binding defines the degree of binding of a drug to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is a key characteristic of antibiotics since it affects both their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In highly bound antibiotics, simple minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing in protein-free standard medium does not reflect activity in patients. Protein binding can be measured by different methods, e.g. equilibrium dialysis (reference method), ultrafiltration, ultracentrifugation. The two major plasma proteins that bind antibiotics are serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein.
Pneumonia	An infection of the lungs where the air sacs (alveoli) fill with fluid and pus making breathing difficult. Bacterial pneumonia can follow from an infection by respiratory viruses such as influenza. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) affects people outside hospital. Pneumonia can also occur in patients while in hospital (hospital-acquired pneumonia, HAP), particularly when patients are on mechanical ventilation (ventilator-associated pneumonia, VAP). Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses and fungi. The organisms causing bacterial community-acquired pneumonia are usually different to those responsible for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
Power (clinical trials)	The probability of detecting a true effect in an experimental study. Clinical trials involve a subset of a population of interest. Results are then extrapolated to the population of a whole. However, this raises the risk that the effects seen in the trial are not representative of those that would be seen in the whole population. This risk is greatest when sample sizes are small. Power analysis is used to provide a measure of confidence in results and to ensure the statistical validity of extrapolation to larger populations. Power analysis is a key element of study design, particularly to identify appropriate sample sizes (in clinical trials, how many people need to be recruited). As recruitment can be challenging, there is an incentive to minimize the number of participants in a study. However, with small numbers, it can be difficult to be confident that observed effects provide a reliable indication of an intervention’s effects. A second key factor affecting the power of a study and sample sizes is the effect size that indicates a clinically meaningful change and can be used to judge whether an intervention has demonstrated efficacy. Detecting a small change will require large numbers of participants to provide good statistical confidence. Power analyses are used to provide an estimate of the likelihood (expressed as a percentage) that a particular effect size will be seen for a particular sample size. In practice, preferred likelihoods and effect sizes are selected in order to identify appropriate sample sizes (e.g. a 95% probability of detecting a 20% decrease in an outcome measure of interest). If a study includes too few participants for statistically robust conclusions to be drawn, it is described as underpowered.
Preclinical development	The preclinical phase of drug development refers to testing of activity and toxicity of a drug candidate in in vitro and in vivo studies before testing in patients can be performed. The preclinical development stage begins when a viable candidate for formal preclinical development has been chosen. The programme is informed by guidance documents issued by regulatory agencies and includes CMC, animal toxicology, pharmacological data, and clinical protocols and investigator information. The goal of preclinical development is to submit data for review to the regulatory agencies to approve clinical testing of the drug in humans.
Pro-drug	A drug that is administered in an inactive form and is metabolized in the body into a pharmacologically active agent. A pro-drug may be developed if a biologically active compound has poor pharmacokinetic properties, for example if it is not absorbed well or rapidly excreted.
Prokaryotic cell	A cell that lacks a nucleus enclosed within a nuclear envelope and membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria. Prokaryotes are single-celled life forms. They include bacteria as well as archaea, which resemble bacteria but also share genetic and biochemical features with eukaryotes. There is little evidence that archaea cause disease in humans.
Prolongation of QT interval	A cardiac abnormality in which the heart muscle takes longer than normal to recharge between beats. The QT interval is a measurement made on an electrocardiogram, which is used to assess the electrical behaviour of the heart. It equates approximately to the time taken between the heart ventricles beginning to contract and when they finish relaxing. Prolongation of the QT interval means that the heart muscle takes longer than normal to prepare to contract. Excessive QT prolongation can trigger abnormal heart rhythms (tachycardia). Prolongation of the QT interval is seen in a range of conditions. It can also be triggered by several drug treatments (including use of some antibiotics). For this reason, regulatory authorities typically require drug developers to provide data on a drug’s effects on the QT interval.
Pseudomonas	A genus of Gram-negative, aerobic non-fermenting bacilli that are commonly found in the environment. P. aeruginosa is a clinically relevant species in hospitalised patients. P. aeruginosa is a common cause of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). It can cause many types of infection, including bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections and pneumonia. It is a common bacterial infection of the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa is naturally resistant to many antibiotics and is also adept at acquiring resistance through horizontal gene transfer and mutations in genes on its chromosome. Its resistance mechanisms include the ability to increased production of multiple drug efflux pumps and decrease production of porin proteins. Together these reduce the intracellular concentrations of many antibiotics. P. aeruginosa is categorized by WHO as a ‘priority 1 (critical)’ pathogen for R&D of new antibiotics.
QT study	A clinical study to assess the potential of a drug to affect heart rhythms. Some drugs, including antibiotics, can lengthen the time it takes for the heart muscles to prepare for contraction, known as prolongation of the QT interval. The QT interval is a measurement made on an electrocardiogram. Because of this risk, regulatory authorities require that drug developers provide evidence of their drug’s impact on the QT interval.
Qualified infectious disease product (QIDP)	A US incentive scheme designed to promote the development of antibacterial and antifungal drugs to treat serious or life-threatening infections. It was introduced in the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act in 2012. QIDP designation confers particular advantages, including priority review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and fast-track designation, which can accelerate development of a product, as well as an additional five years’ market exclusivity if a product is licensed.
Quality assurance (clinical trials)	Measures taken to ensure that a clinical study is conducted and reported according to its agreed protocol, and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and any other relevant regulatory requirements. Quality assurance is based on a planned and systematic set of activities to ensure that all aspects of a clinical trial are carried out to a high standard. These activities are essential to protect the health and wellbeing of participants in trials and to ensure that the data obtained are reliable.
Randomized clinical trial (RCT)	A clinical study in which the participants are allocated randomly to receive an experimental clinical intervention (such as a new antibiotic) or a control intervention. RCTs are considered the most rigorous test of efficacy of a new treatment. The control intervention may be a placebo or the usually used treatment for a condition (standard of care). Ideally, neither patient nor experimenter should know which treatment is being given (a double-blind RCT). If it is not possible for the experimenter not to be aware of the treatment, a single-blind design is used. In open-label trials, both patient and experimenter are aware which treatment is being provided. This creates a significant risk of bias. Various methods are used to reduce the risk of bias, such as assessment of outcomes by an individual who does not know which treatment was given.
Sepsis	Life-threatening organ failure caused by a dysregulated host response, often to an infection. In informal use, sepsis often refers to a bloodstream bacterial infection (BSI), and the term is sometimes used synonymously with septicaemia. More than 19 million cases of sepsis and 5 million sepsis-related deaths are estimated to occur each year, most of them in low- and middle-income countries. Sepsis causes nearly half a million deaths in the newborn period each year. Globally, antimicrobial resistance contributes to one-third of neonatal sepsis deaths.
Septic shock	Severe sepsis in which dangerously low blood pressure substantially increases the risk of organ failure and death.
Serious adverse event (SAE)	Any unfavourable occurrence in a trial participant that has a major impact on their health. All SAEs occurring during a trial must be documented in clinical study reports and whether they are considered related to participation in the trial. Independent investigations are carried out to determine whether the SAE was potentially related to the trial intervention or was a random occurrence. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are those considered likely to have been caused by the study intervention.
Skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI)	Microbial invasion of the layers of the skin and underlying soft tissues. The FDA defines acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) as a bacterial infection of the skin with a lesion size area of at least 75 cm2 (cellulitis, erysipelas, wound infection, major cutaneous abscess). The EMA classification of bacterial skin and soft tissue infection (BSSTI) includes cellulitis, erysipelas, wound infections (traumatic or post-surgical) and major abscesses. Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) are the most severe and involve deeper soft tissue. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of cSSTIs, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) a particular challenge.
Small molecule	A chemical/antimicrobial with a mass usually less than 1000 daltons. Small molecules have long been the preferred type of pharmaceutical. Their advantages include relative ease of chemical manufacture, pharmacologic predictability, ability to enter cells and potential for oral use.
Standard of care (SOC)	Treatment that is accepted by medical experts as the most appropriate for a certain type of disease in a particular setting and is widely used by healthcare professionals. Also called best practice, standard medical care, best available therapy and standard therapy. When new treatments are being evaluated in clinical trials, they will generally be compared with standard of care or as an addition to standard of care.
Staphylococcus	A genus of Gram-positive facultatively anaerobic cocci including Staphylococcus aureus that includes several that infect humans,. S. aureus is a common commensal bacterium. However, it can cause infections in the bloodstream, skin- and soft tissue, as well as other body sites. It is also an important cause of infections associated with implants and medical devices. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and community-acquired MRSA infections have also been detected. Methicillin resistance is generally associated with the presence of the mecA gene, part of a mobile genetic element known as the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). S. aureus can be multidrug resistant and MRSA can be resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics too. It is categorized by WHO as a ‘priority 2 (high)’ pathogen for R&D of new antibiotics.
Streptococcus	A genus of Gram-positive cocci that includes several species of bacteria that cause infections in people. S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes are the most clinically relevant streptococci. S. pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, is a commensal bacterium that can become invasive and pathogenic. It is a major cause of community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis but can cause a wide range of other infections. Group A streptococci (GAS, primarily S. pyogenes) typically infect the throat and skin and can develop into serious invasive infections. Group B streptococci (GBS, S. agalactiae) are the leading cause of disease in new-born babies worldwide and show increasing levels of resistance to second line antibiotics such as macrolides and clindamycin.
Superiority trial	A superiority trial design aims to show that one treatment is clinically better than the other by demonstrating superiority of the test agent over placebo or an active treatment. Regulatory agencies require a superiority trial when there is no licensed comparator available or the treatment effect of any licensed treatment is unknown or is considered questionable (e.g. acute self-limiting infections). For adjunctive treatments, the superiority design demonstrates a clinical effect of the adjunctive treatment vs. standard of care.
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR)	Any unfavourable occurrence in a trial participant that is judged to have a major impact on their health, was not anticipated and could potentially be due to the intervention under investigation. SUSARs must be rapidly communicated to regulatory authorities. Trials may be suspended while a SUSAR is investigated.
Target candidate profile (TCP)	The desired characteristics of a preclinical drug candidate. A TCP covers key features such as antimicrobial activity, specificity, stability and physicochemical properties. It is used during early research and development (R&D) phases to select the best compounds to work on and to guide optimization of chemical structures and properties through medicinal chemistry.
Target product profile (TPP)	The desired characteristics of a new drug or other medical intervention (such as a diagnostic tool). TPPs include key factors such as nature of infection, age group, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability, stability, route of administration, dosing frequency and cost. They are often developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) or other bodies to provide a global consensus on the requirements of a new drug or medical intervention, to guide research and development (R&D) activities.
Target validation	Confirmation that inhibition of a bacterial target structure or enzymatic activity is likely to be clinically useful. A bacterial target is critical to its survival or multiplication. However, it must be shown in vitro or in animal models that inhibition of the target is pharmacologically possible and impairs microbial growth, that it cannot be readily overcome by adaptation of other microbial pathways, and that has no significant impact on the host. Stage of infection must also be considered. A bacterial protein important in late stages of infection, when the host has already been infected, may be a less promising target than one essential to an early stage of infection.
Therapeutic index	The ratio of the blood concentration at which a drug becomes toxic (TD50) and the concentration at which it is effective (ED50). Dosage of drugs with a low therapeutic index can be challenging, as relatively small increases in drug levels can trigger side effects. Such drugs are said to have a small therapeutic window.
Therapeutic window	"The dose range of a drug that provides safe and effective therapy with minimal adverse effects. Generally, at low concentrations, a drug runs the risk of being ineffective; at high concentrations, the risk of adverse effects is increased. Dosing regimens are designed to maintain drug concentrations within therapeutic windows, maximizing efficacy and minimizing side effects."
Tissue concentration	Tissue concentration describes the concentration of a drug in a tissue without specifying the pharmacological compartment of the tissue. For a drug to be able to treat a specific infectious disease it is necessary that the drug is available at the site of infection. Tissues are made of distinct pharmacological compartments (interstitial fluid, cells, and within cells the various subcellular organelles) in which the drug is usually not distributed equally. Therefore, commonly used measurements in tissue homogenates are not informative with respect to the (active) concentration of the antimicrobial at the site of infection. Since most bacterial infections are located in the extracellular compartment, these concentrations are of primary interest. If a compound is distributed mainly extracellularly, such as β-lactams and aminoglycosides, grinding up the tissue means dilution of the drug by mixing intracellular and extracellular fluids, resulting in an underestimation of its concentrations at the site of infection. Conversely, if drugs are accumulated by cells (such as fluoroquinolones or macrolides), assay of total tissue levels will lead to a gross overestimation of the extracellular concentration. The opposite is true for intracellular infections.
Toxicity	The harmful effects of a drug. Toxicity is one of the most common reasons for a drug to fail during clinical development. Toxicology studies traditionally focused on the effects of a drug in animal models, but increasingly in vitro cellular and biochemical approaches are also being used. To a degree, potential toxicity issues can now also be predicted on the basis of chemical structures (‘in silico toxicology’).
Urinary tract infection (UTI)	An infection in any part of the urinary system (kidney, ureter, bladder or urethra). UTIs, particularly by E. coli in women, are extremely common. Widespread use of antibiotics has led to high levels of drug-resistant bacteria that cause UTIs, many caused by bacteria carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Complicated UTIs (cUTIs) are usually in people with underlying conditions, for example structural or functional abnormalities in the urinary system, other underlying health issues, or the impact of medical interventions such as use of catheters. Most UTIs in older people are cUTIs. cUTIs increase the risk of treatment failure, complications and antibiotic resistance.
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)	A lung infection that develops in a patient who is on a ventilator. VAP is the most common infection acquired in intensive care units and is associated with high mortality. It can be caused by multiple microbes, and the need to treat rapidly leads to use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Treatment is increasingly difficult in many settings due to drug-resistant infections, particularly multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and other ‘ESKAPE’ pathogens. The organisms responsible for VAP are generally different from those causing pneumonia outside the hospital (community-acquired pneumonia).
WHO priority pathogens	A list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria assessed to be of highest priority for new antibiotic development. The global priority pathogens list (global PPL), published in 2017, was developed by an expert group convened by the World Health Organization and took into account a range of criteria such as global disease burden. The list, which includes 12 groups of pathogens in three priority categories (critical, high, medium), provides a framework for prioritizing global research and development (R&D).
