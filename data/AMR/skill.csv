1,Drug Discovery,Gram-positive bacteria,"Characterization of bacteria according to their appearance after Gram staining, which reflects differences in the structure of their cell walls. The cell envelopes of most bacteria fall into one of two major groups. In addition to a cytoplasmic/inner membrane, Gram-negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan cell wall and an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide. Between the two membranes is the periplasm where enzymes such as beta-lactamases are found. Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer membrane but have a much thicker peptidoglycan layer than Gram-negative organisms. There is no periplasm and enzymes e.g., beta-lactamases are excreted to the outside of the cell. This distinction has important implications for antibiotic development. Many antibiotics target proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis so have to traverse the outer membrane and periplasm in Gram-negative bacteria. Hence, the complex cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria presents a significant barrier to the entry of antibiotics into the cell. Gram-negative bacteria include many multidrug-resistant species, including all three of the highest priorities in the WHO priority pathogen list for R&D of new antibiotics.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/gram-positive-negative/

4,Drug Discovery,Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing,"The lowest concentration of an antibiotic that prevents the visible growth of bacteria. Potent antibiotics, therefore, have low MIC values. As bacteria become less susceptible to an antibiotic, MIC values increase. To categorize microbes as drug-resistant, the MIC values are compared with standardized recommended breakpoint concentrations.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/minimal-inhibitory-concentration-mic/
5,Drug Discovery,Target identification,,
6,Drug Discovery,Target validation,"Confirmation that inhibition of a bacterial target structure or enzymatic activity is likely to be clinically useful. A bacterial target is critical to its survival or multiplication. However, it must be shown in vitro or in animal models that inhibition of the target is pharmacologically possible and impairs microbial growth, that it cannot be readily overcome by adaptation of other microbial pathways, and that has no significant impact on the host. Stage of infection must also be considered. A bacterial protein important in late stages of infection, when the host has already been infected, may be a less promising target than one essential to an early stage of infection.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/target-validation/
7,Drug Discovery,High-throughput screening (HTS),"The process by which large numbers of natural product extracts or chemicals (compound libraries) are tested for antimicrobial activity using automated and/or robotic equipment. High-throughput screens can either test the ability of compounds to inhibit a specific bacterial target or, more generally, to inhibit the growth of bacterial cells (see: �bacteriostatic�) or kill bacteria (see: �bactericidal�). Compounds discovered to have antibacterial activity in initial screens are known as �hits�.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/high-throughput-screen-hts/
8,Drug Discovery,Hit confirmation | hit validation,"Evaluation of a compound discovered to have antibacterial properties (a hit), by confirming its ability to inhibit bacterial growth, assessing its binding to molecular targets of interest, and determining its chemical structure. Hit validation is essential for eliminating false-positives from high-throughput screens, demonstrating that a compound has the potential to be an effective treatment, with no obvious chemical features that would make it difficult to develop into a drug.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/hit-confirmation-hit-validation/
9,Drug Discovery,Medicinal chemistry,"The design, synthesis and modification of biologically active molecules. Medicinal chemistry plays a critical role in converting a newly discovered molecule with antibacterial activity (a hit) into a safe and effective candidate. Key steps include modifying the molecule to explore the relationship between chemical structure and antibacterial activity (structure-activity relationship, SAR) and adapting the molecule to improve its efficacy and drug-like properties (lead optimization).",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/medicinal-chemistry/
10,Drug Discovery,Hit-to-lead (HTL) | lead generation,"A stage of drug discovery during which a compound demonstrated to have antibacterial properties (a hit) is iteratively modified to improve its efficacy and other properties. Typically, multiple chemical variants of a hit compound are synthesized (hit expansion). Studies of these compounds help to identify key structural features of the compound associated with binding to molecular targets and efficacy (structure�activity relationships). Chemical modifications are also introduced to improve its drug-like properties, such as stability, membrane permeability, cytotoxicity and specificity. This stage ends with one or more optimized lead compounds that are extensively evaluated for efficacy and safety in biochemical and cellular assays and in animal studies.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/hit-to-lead-htl-lead-generation/
11,Drug Discovery,Mechanism of action (MoA),"The specific biochemical interaction through which an antimicrobial produces its pharmacological effect. For antibiotics, the most common mechanisms of action are: Inhibition of cell wall synthesis Inhibition of protein synthesis Disruption of cell membranes Inhibition of DNA replication or transcription Inhibition of bacterial metabolism For compounds identified in phenotypic screens, mechanisms of action may not be immediately obvious. Further studies are required to understand how they achieve their antibacterial effects. Determining mechanism of action is important because it suggests what modifications could be made to a compound to improve its activity and specificity. In addition, antibiotics used as combinations should ideally have different mechanisms of actions, to make it harder for bacteria to develop resistance to treatment.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/mechanism-of-action-moa/
12,Drug Discovery,Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) | resistance testing,"Assessing the concentration of a drug, chemical or other substance required to inhibit microbial growth or to kill a microbe. Through bodies such as the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), internationally agreed standards have been developed to guide rigorous assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/antimicrobial-susceptibility-testing-ast-resistance-testing/

14,Drug Discovery,Natural products,"Natural products are small molecules produced by living organisms including plants, invertebrates and microorganisms. They are also known as secondary metabolites being non-essential for life, but they play key roles in defence and cell to cell communication. They represent a unique chemical space with compounds distributed in a broad diversity of chemical classes. They have been evolving with nature together with the activities that have been optimized together with the targets. Pharmaceutical companies have been using natural products for decades as one of the major sources for discovery of novel bio-active compounds and today more than 50% of the molecules in development are still natural products, semi-synthetic derivatives or have been inspired in these scaffolds. Today, natural products are still an untapped reservoir with more than 90% of the microbial sources still underexplored and with biosynthetic potential that by far exceeds the initial estimations. This is why natural products still represent one of the major sources of chemical diversity and one of the starting points for the discovery of novel antibiotics.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/natural-products/
15,Drug Discovery,Pro-drugs,"A drug that is administered in an inactive form and is metabolized in the body into a pharmacologically active agent.

16,Drug Discovery,Drug combinations,,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMIT_0005594
17,Drug Discovery,Absorption distribution metabolism elimination (ADME),"The key factors affecting the concentration and distribution of a drug within the body and the time it spends in the body. Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. How a drug is absorbed, distributed across different tissues (or �compartments�), metabolized and eliminated (e.g. excreted) will all affect its ability to access its target site and have a biological effect. ADME are the core elements of pharmacokinetics.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/absorption-distribution-metabolism-elimination-adme/
18,Drug Discovery,In-vitro toxicity testing - Ames,"A method for evaluating the mutagenic effects of a compound or drug, used as part of toxicity testing. The test chemical is applied to a bacterial strain that has a mutation which renders it dependent on histidine for growth, along with a rat liver extract (to explore the potential for enzymatic processing of the chemical into a mutagenic form). After culture, the number of colonies that can grow in the absence of histidine, due to reversion of the mutation, provides a measure of the mutagenic potential of the chemical. There is a reasonable degree of correlation between mutagenicity as judged by the Ames essay and carcinogenicity in animal models. However, it is a screening tool with limited predictability when used without other assays.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/ames-test/
19,Drug Discovery,In-vivo efficacy evaluation,,
20,Drug Discovery,In-vivo toxicity testing,,
21,Drug Discovery,Pharmacokinetics (PK),"Study of the body�s handling and metabolism of drugs in the body, including their absorption, distribution between different tissues, localization within tissues, modification and excretion (see: �ADME�). Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. If the body does not absorb a drug, modifies it chemically, or rapidly excretes it, the drug will be less able to bind to its target site and have a biological effect. Broadly speaking, pharmacokinetics considers the effect of the body on a drug, while pharmacodynamics considers the properties of a drug that affect target engagement in the body. Population PK modelling takes account of variation in how drugs are metabolized by different people within a population. This requires more sophisticated statistical methodologies but provides results more relevant to individuals. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models are more closely based on human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry. They are complex multi-component models that more accurately reflect human biology but are also more challenging to develop.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/pharmacokinetics-pk/
22,Drug Discovery,Pharmacodynamics (PD),"Study of the uptake, movement, binding and interactions of drugs in the body and how they affect drug activity. Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. Any factor affecting drug concentration at its target site, strength of binding or duration of binding will affect that drug�s pharmacological activity and clinical responses. Broadly speaking, pharmacodynamics considers the properties of a drug that affect target engagement in the body, while pharmacokinetics considers the effect of the body on a drug.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/pharmacodynamics-pd/

28,Drug Development,Adaptive trial design,"A clinical trial that can be modified mid-way through based on preliminary analysis of results. Adaptive trials are efficient ways of testing more than one drug at a time, or different doses of a drug. If initial data suggest that a treatment is not working, or is inferior to a comparator, recruitment into that treatment arm can be halted. Adaptive trials were pioneered in oncology but are increasingly being used in other areas of medicine.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/adaptive-trial/
29,Drug Development,Biological license application (BLA),"A request to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for permission to market a new biologic product. Formally, a BLA is defined as a request for �permission to introduce, or deliver for introduction, a biologic product into interstate commerce in the US�. A BLA is broadly equivalent to a new drug application (NDA) for traditional small-molecule drugs. It should contain all the information needed to demonstrate the product�s safety, potency and purity.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/biologics-license-application-bla/

33,Drug Development,Investigational new drug (IND) submission,"A novel drug, ready to be tested for safety and efficacy in people. Before a new drug or biological product can be tested on people in the USA, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application must be made to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). An IND application must include information on safety in animal models, on manufacturing processes and quality assurance (CMC), the design of the proposed clinical studies, and the qualifications of the investigators due to carry out the study. The IND process is designed to enable regulators to assess whether a drug is safe to test in humans and has promise as a potential treatment. In Europe, a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) must be made to national regulatory agencies to secure approval for studies on humans.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/investigational-new-drug-ind/

Mortality in patients infected with these bacteria is high (around 50% on average) but very variable.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/pandrug-resistant/
37,Drug Development,Patient related documentation creation (eg. informed consent),"Agreement from a potential participant that he or she is willing to take part in a clinical study and is aware of what the study involves. The principle of informed consent ensures that participants willingly take part in clinical studies and are fully aware of what the studies involve. To give informed consent, a potential participant must have received sufficient information in a format that enables them to understand the implications of their decision, and they must have sufficient reasoning powers to interpret the information provided.
