1,Pre-clinical,"Absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination (ADME)","The key factors affecting the concentration and distribution of a drug within the body and the time it spends in the body. Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. How a drug is absorbed, distributed across different tissues (or ‘compartments’), metabolized and eliminated (e.g. excreted) will all affect its ability to access its target site and have a biological effect. ADME are the core elements of pharmacokinetics.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/absorption-distribution-metabolism-elimination-adme/
2,Clinical,Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API),"The chemical component of a drug treatment that is biologically active. In addition to an API, drug formulations may include a range of other biologically inactive materials, for example, to promote stability or to facilitate the manufacture of tablets or liquid medicines.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/active-pharmaceutical-ingredient-api/
3,Clinical,Adaptive trial,"A clinical trial that can be modified mid-way through based on preliminary analysis of results. Adaptive trials are efficient ways of testing more than one drug at a time, or different doses of a drug. If initial data suggest that a treatment is not working, or is inferior to a comparator, recruitment into that treatment arm can be halted. Adaptive trials were pioneered in oncology but are increasingly being used in other areas of medicine.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/adaptive-trial/
4,Pre-clinical,Ames test,"A method for evaluating the mutagenic effects of a compound or drug, used as part of toxicity testing. The test chemical is applied to a bacterial strain that has a mutation which renders it dependent on histidine for growth, along with a rat liver extract (to explore the potential for enzymatic processing of the chemical into a mutagenic form). After culture, the number of colonies that can grow in the absence of histidine, due to reversion of the mutation, provides a measure of the mutagenic potential of the chemical. There is a reasonable degree of correlation between mutagenicity as judged by the Ames essay and carcinogenicity in animal models. However, it is a screening tool with limited predictability when used without other assays.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/ames-test/
5,Discovery,"Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), resistance testing","Assessing the concentration of a drug, chemical or other substance required to inhibit microbial growth or to kill a microbe. Through bodies such as the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), internationally agreed standards have been developed to guide rigorous assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/antimicrobial-susceptibility-testing-ast-resistance-testing/
6,Discovery,Bacterial efflux,"Bacterial efflux describes a process where molecules are pumped from inside bacterial cells to outside. This is done by molecular machines called efflux pumps. These are found in the membrane of bacterial cells and they are very important because they contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Many antibiotics work by getting inside bacterial cells where they interact with a specific target. Efflux pumps are able to physically pump those antibiotic molecules back out of the cell again which keeps the intracellular concentration below toxic levels meaning bacteria can survive at higher concentrations of the drug.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/bacterial-efflux/
7,Discovery,Bacterial target,"A molecule in the bacterial cell that has a critical cellular function and can be altered or inhibited by an antimicrobial to negatively impact its’s growth or survival.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/bacterial-target/
8,Clinical,Beta-lactamase,"Bacterial enzyme that hydrolyses and inactivates beta-lactam antibiotics, leading to antibiotic resistance. Beta-lactamases target the four-atom beta-lactam ring found in beta-lactam antibiotics. In the most used classification system, Ambler classification, beta-lactamases are grouped into four classes (A–D) based on amino acid sequence homologies. Ambler class A beta-lactamases include enzymes that are active on extended-spectrum cephalosporins (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ESBLs). Ambler class B enzymes rely on zinc for their activity and are also known as metallo-beta-lactamases. Ambler class D beta-lactamases were originally known as oxacillinases, owing to their rapid action on oxacillin, and are also known as OXA beta-lactamases. OXA enzymes have emerged as an important cause of carbapenem resistance, initially in Acinetobacter baumannii. OXA-type ESBLs have since spread to other bacterial families, including Enterobacteriaceae.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/beta-lactamase/
9,Clinical,Biologics license application (BLA),"A request to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for permission to market a new biologic product. Formally, a BLA is defined as a request for “permission to introduce, or deliver for introduction, a biologic product into interstate commerce in the US”. A BLA is broadly equivalent to a new drug application (NDA) for traditional small-molecule drugs. It should contain all the information needed to demonstrate the product’s safety, potency and purity.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/biologics-license-application-bla/
10,Clinical,Bloodstream infection (BSI),"An infection of the blood that is circulated around the body. Blood is normally a sterile environment. Microbes from other parts of the body or the external environment can gain access to and multiply within blood. Bloodstream infections can be life threatening. An immune response to bacteria in the bloodstream can lead to sepsis, characterized by fever and low blood pressure, and if untreated multiple organ failure and death. Bloodstream infections are e responsible for high levels of morbidity and mortality. Many different types of microorganisms can establish bloodstream infections, and there is considerable variation in causative microorganisms in different parts of the world. Invasive medical procedures increase the risk of bloodstream infections, and so are common hospital-acquired infections. Bloodstream infections may be caused by drug-resistant microorganisms, and rising numbers of Gram-negative bacterial bloodstream infections are of great concern as these can be difficult to treat.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/bloodstream-infection-bsi/
11,Clinical,Candidate,"A compound with strong therapeutic potential whose activity and specificity have been optimized. Hits obtained by high-throughput screening have potential to become antibiotic drugs. Their antibacterial properties must be confirmed, and their structure may need to be modified to maximize their activity or other properties that will make them suitable to be used as drugs. At the end of this process, the resulting compound is considered a ‘candidate’ and potentially suitable for clinical trials.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/candidate/
12,Clinical,"Chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC)","Chemistry, manufacturing and controls; also referred to as pharmaceutical quality/CMC. The term covers the various procedures used to assess the physical and chemical characteristics of drug products, and to ensure their quality and consistency during manufacturing. CMC data are an important part of submissions to regulatory authorities.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/chemistry-manufacturing-and-controls-cmc/
13,Clinical,"Clearance, renal","Removal of a substance from the body by the kidney and its excretion in urine. In pharmacologic terms, it is a pharmacokinetic measurement of the volume of plasma from which a substance is completely removed per unit time. Renal clearance is the principal route through which most drugs are removed from the body. Dosing of antibiotics may need to be adjusted in people with impaired renal function, as some antibiotics are toxic at high concentrations.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/clearance-renal/
14,Clinical,Clinical Development,"Testing of a new drug or treatment in people. Early stages of drug discovery and development involve in vitro studies and work on animal models. After this preclinical phase, promising drugs enter clinical development, which typically involves three distinct phases of clinical trials: Phase 1: first use in human volunteers, to assess safety and pharmacokinetics Phase 2: first testing in patients, to check safety, provisional efficacy, and to test different doses Phase 3: efficacy testing in a larger number of patients",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/clinical-development/
15,Clinical,Clinical study report (CSR),"Comprehensive report of an individual study conducted in patients of any therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic agent. A CSR must include an explanation of critical design features of the study, methods and how the study was carried out, individual patient data, and details of analytical methods.

They are submitted to regulatory authorities and ethics committees and are a key element of submissions for regulatory approval.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/clinical-study-report-csr/
16,Clinical,"Dosing: BID, TID","BID: bis in die, twice a day; TID: ter in die: three times a day. The appropriate dosing regimen for a drug depends on exposure-response relationships and is based on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence. Depending on the drug class and its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, different dosing regimens may be optimal, including once a day (omne in die, OD), twice a day (bis in die, BID) or three times a day (ter in die, TID).",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/dosing-bid-tid/

18,Discovery,Efflux-mediated resistance,"Resistance to antibiotics related to the presence of pumps that pump antibiotic molecules from the inside of the bacterial cell to the outside. Structurally and mechanistically diverse efflux pumps in the cell envelope play an important role in both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/efflux-mediated-resistance/
19,Clinical,Eligibility criteria (inclusion/exclusion),https://revive.gardp.org/resource/eligibility-criteria-inclusion-exclusion/
20,Clinical,"Endpoint, clinical trial","The principal outcome that is measured in a clinical trial. Clinical trials typically assess multiple endpoints. The primary endpoint relates specifically to the anticipated clinical impact of an intervention, such as cure or survival, to provide a measure of its efficacy. Secondary endpoints can provide additional information on the effects of an intervention and on mechanisms of action, as well as on possible specific safety issues. Exploratory endpoints cover clinical outcomes likely to be rare or measures that allow hypotheses to be tested. It is essential that endpoints are selected that provide a reliable assessment of the benefits of an intervention and hence its efficacy. They must be acceptable to all stakeholders, particularly regulatory authorities, which must have confidence in the validity and reliability of endpoints to approve new treatments.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/endpoint-clinical-trial/
21,Clinical,Extensively drug-resistant (XDR),"Non-susceptibility to at least one agent in all but one or two antimicrobial categories (i.e. bacterial isolates remain susceptible to drugs from at most two classes of antibiotic). XDR organisms are resistant to more drugs than multidrug-resistant (MDR) microbes and often require use of relatively toxic drugs, high doses of drugs or drug combinations. Acquisition of additional resistance mechanisms has the potential to turn them into pandrug-resistant (PDR) organisms, resistant to all available antibiotics.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/extensively-drug-resistant-xdr/
22,Clinical,First-in-human (FIH),"Synonym: first-in-man (FIM), First study of a novel intervention in humans. First-in-human studies are usually carried out in healthy volunteers. Their principal role is to assess the safety of new interventions. They may incorporate a dose-escalation study design (single ascending dose or SAD study) to identify the optimum dose for use in future trials. First-in-human studies are also used to gather data on the effects of a new drug in humans and how it is metabolized. First-in-human studies are phase 1 trials.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/first-in-human/
23,Clinical,Good clinical practice (GCP),"Internationally agreed ethical and scientific quality standards for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve human participants. Adherence to Good Clinical Practice ensures that the rights, safety, and wellbeing of participants are respected and protected, and that clinical trial data are reliable. Compliance with Good Clinical Practice is generally a legal obligation for all studies of investigational medical products involving human participants.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/good-clinical-practice/
24,Pre-clinical,Good Laboratory Practice (GLP),"A quality assurance system to ensure the uniformity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility, quality and integrity of data from non-clinical studies to be submitted to regulatory authorities. Compliance with Good Laboratory Practice standards is essential for laboratory data to be accepted by regulatory authorities in regulatory submissions.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/good-laboratory-practice-glp/
25,Clinical,Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP),"A quality assurance system for manufacturers to ensure that their products are consistently high in quality from batch to batch. Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines are designed to ensure the safety and activity of manufactured pharmaceutical products. Global standards have been developed by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and the World Health Organization. Enforcement is the responsibility of national regulatory authorities.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/good-manufacturing-practice-gmp/
26,Discovery,Gram-positive/negative,"Characterization of bacteria according to their appearance after Gram staining, which reflects differences in the structure of their cell walls. The cell envelopes of most bacteria fall into one of two major groups. In addition to a cytoplasmic/inner membrane, Gram-negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan cell wall and an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide. Between the two membranes is the periplasm where enzymes such as beta-lactamases are found. Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer membrane but have a much thicker peptidoglycan layer than Gram-negative organisms. There is no periplasm and enzymes e.g., beta-lactamases are excreted to the outside of the cell. This distinction has important implications for antibiotic development. Many antibiotics target proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis so have to traverse the outer membrane and periplasm in Gram-negative bacteria. Hence, the complex cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria presents a significant barrier to the entry of antibiotics into the cell. Gram-negative bacteria include many multidrug-resistant species, including all three of the highest priorities in the WHO priority pathogen list for R&D of new antibiotics.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/gram-positive-negative/
27,Discovery,High-throughput screen (HTS),"The process by which large numbers of natural product extracts or chemicals (compound libraries) are tested for antimicrobial activity using automated and/or robotic equipment. High-throughput screens can either test the ability of compounds to inhibit a specific bacterial target or, more generally, to inhibit the growth of bacterial cells (see: ‘bacteriostatic‘) or kill bacteria (see: ‘bactericidal‘). Compounds discovered to have antibacterial activity in initial screens are known as ‘hits’.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/high-throughput-screen-hts/
28,Discovery,"Hit confirmation, hit validation","Evaluation of a compound discovered to have antibacterial properties (a hit), by confirming its ability to inhibit bacterial growth, assessing its binding to molecular targets of interest, and determining its chemical structure. Hit validation is essential for eliminating false-positives from high-throughput screens, demonstrating that a compound has the potential to be an effective treatment, with no obvious chemical features that would make it difficult to develop into a drug.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/hit-confirmation-hit-validation/
29,Discovery,"Hit identification, hit discovery","Testing for compounds that have antibacterial properties (hits), for example by high-throughput screening of compound libraries. Hits are an important starting point in drug discovery and development. However, they may require considerable chemical modification to enhance their antibacterial activity and other properties. Very few initial hits become antibiotics licensed to treat infections.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/hit-identification-hit-discovery/
30,Discovery,"Hit-to-lead (HTL), lead generation","A stage of drug discovery during which a compound demonstrated to have antibacterial properties (a hit) is iteratively modified to improve its efficacy and other properties. Typically, multiple chemical variants of a hit compound are synthesized (hit expansion). Studies of these compounds help to identify key structural features of the compound associated with binding to molecular targets and efficacy (structure–activity relationships). Chemical modifications are also introduced to improve its drug-like properties, such as stability, membrane permeability, cytotoxicity and specificity. This stage ends with one or more optimized lead compounds that are extensively evaluated for efficacy and safety in biochemical and cellular assays and in animal studies.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/hit-to-lead-htl-lead-generation/
31,Clinical,Informed consent,"Agreement from a potential participant that he or she is willing to take part in a clinical study and is aware of what the study involves. The principle of informed consent ensures that participants willingly take part in clinical studies and are fully aware of what the studies involve. To give informed consent, a potential participant must have received sufficient information in a format that enables them to understand the implications of their decision, and they must have sufficient reasoning powers to interpret the information provided. Special procedures are applied for those unable to give informed consent, for example, because of age, a decline in cognitive abilities or severe illness.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/informed-consent/
32,Clinical,Intra-abdominal infection (IAI),"A group of infections that occur within the abdominal cavity. IAIs are a common cause of gastrointestinal emergency procedures and responsible for high levels of morbidity and mortality. An uncomplicated IAI (uIAI) involves only a single organ and does not extend to the peritoneum, a two-layer membrane that lines the abdominal cavity. A complicated IAI (cIAI) involves more than one organ and infection of the peritoneal space, the gap between the two layers of the peritoneum, leading to abscesses or peritonitis. Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria can cause IAIs and these can be drug-resistant.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/intra-abdominal-infection-iai/
33,Clinical,Investigational medicinal product (IMP),"Any medicinal product that is being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial. IMPs include newly developed drugs but also licensed drugs that are being tested against a new condition, or in a new formulation or packaging, or are being used to gather more information about the authorised form. Regulatory authorities mandate specific procedures for manufacturing and handling of IMPs, to ensure their quality and safety and hence the validity of clinical trial data.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/investigational-medicinal-product-imp/
34,Clinical,Investigational new drug (IND),"A novel drug, ready to be tested for safety and efficacy in people. Before a new drug or biological product can be tested on people in the USA, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application must be made to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). An IND application must include information on safety in animal models, on manufacturing processes and quality assurance (CMC), the design of the proposed clinical studies, and the qualifications of the investigators due to carry out the study. The IND process is designed to enable regulators to assess whether a drug is safe to test in humans and has promise as a potential treatment. In Europe, a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) must be made to national regulatory agencies to secure approval for studies on humans.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/investigational-new-drug-ind/
35,Discovery,Lead optimization,"Modifying the chemical characteristics of a molecule to maximize its antimicrobial activity and improve its pharmacological properties. Lead optimization builds on hit expansion, focusing on lead compounds with the most promising properties. Modifications focus on key areas such as strengthening binding to bacterial target molecules, minimizing binding to host structures, which could cause side effects, and ensuring its availability within target tissues in the body. Lead optimization generates one or more candidates for clinical evaluation.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/lead-optimization/
36,Clinical,Marketing authorization application (MAA),"An application made to a European regulatory authority for approval to market a medicine within the European Union (or Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway). An MAA includes comprehensive information about a drug to enable a regulatory authority to judge its quality, safety and efficacy.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/marketing-authorization-application-maa/
37,Pre-clinical,Maximum tolerated dose (MTD),"The highest dose of a medicine or treatment that will produce the desired effect without resulting in unacceptable side effects. Higher concentrations of a drug are more likely to be effective but may induce side effects that deter use or outweigh the benefits of treatment. Maximum tolerated doses are usually determined in animal studies and provide the basis for choosing the range of drug concentrations tested in phase 1 trials (dose escalation).",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/maximum-tolerated-dose-mtd/
38,Discovery,Mechanism of action (MoA),"The specific biochemical interaction through which an antimicrobial produces its pharmacological effect. For antibiotics, the most common mechanisms of action are: Inhibition of cell wall synthesis Inhibition of protein synthesis Disruption of cell membranes Inhibition of DNA replication or transcription Inhibition of bacterial metabolism For compounds identified in phenotypic screens, mechanisms of action may not be immediately obvious. Further studies are required to understand how they achieve their antibacterial effects. Determining mechanism of action is important because it suggests what modifications could be made to a compound to improve its activity and specificity. In addition, antibiotics used as combinations should ideally have different mechanisms of actions, to make it harder for bacteria to develop resistance to treatment.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/mechanism-of-action-moa/
39,Discovery,Medicinal chemistry,"The design, synthesis and modification of biologically active molecules. Medicinal chemistry plays a critical role in converting a newly discovered molecule with antibacterial activity (a hit) into a safe and effective candidate. Key steps include modifying the molecule to explore the relationship between chemical structure and antibacterial activity (structure-activity relationship, SAR) and adapting the molecule to improve its efficacy and drug-like properties (lead optimization).",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/medicinal-chemistry/
40,Discovery,Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC),"The lowest concentration of an antibiotic that prevents the visible growth of bacteria. Potent antibiotics, therefore, have low MIC values. As bacteria become less susceptible to an antibiotic, MIC values increase. To categorize microbes as drug-resistant, the MIC values are compared with standardized recommended breakpoint concentrations.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/minimal-inhibitory-concentration-mic/
41,Discovery,Multidrug-resistant (MDR),"Lack of susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more chemical classes of antibiotic (e.g. a beta-lactam, an aminoglycoside, a macrolide).",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/multidrug-resistant-mdr/
42,Discovery,Natural products,"Natural products are small molecules produced by living organisms including plants, invertebrates and microorganisms. They are also known as secondary metabolites being non-essential for life; but they play key roles in defence and cell to cell communication. They represent a unique chemical space with compounds distributed in a broad diversity of chemical classes. They have been evolving with nature together with the activities that have been optimized together with the targets. Pharmaceutical companies have been using natural products for decades as one of the major sources for discovery of novel bio-active compounds and today more than 50% of the molecules in development are still natural products, semi-synthetic derivatives or have been inspired in these scaffolds. Today, natural products are still an untapped reservoir with more than 90% of the microbial sources still underexplored and with biosynthetic potential that by far exceeds the initial estimations. This is why natural products still represent one of the major sources of chemical diversity and one of the starting points for the discovery of novel antibiotics.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/natural-products/
43,Clinical,"New chemical entity (NCE), new molecular entity (NME)","A novel compound that has not previously been approved for use in humans. NCE (or new drug substance in the EU) is a formal definition used by regulatory authorities, designed to give protection to the developers of new drugs during clinical evaluation phases of drug development. More informally, NCE is used to describe a newly developed drug compound, as opposed to the re-use of an existing drug for a different disease, re-formulation of an existing drug, or a novel combination of existing drugs. Development of new antibiotic treatments depends both on the discovery and development of NCEs.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/new-chemical-entity-nce-new-molecular-entity-nme/
44,Clinical,New drug application (NDA),"The formal process through which a company or other body requests permission from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make and sell a drug in the USA. In Europe, the equivalent process is known as a marketing authorization application (MAA).",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/new-drug-application-nda/
45,Clinical,Observational study,"A clinical study that is used to gather data but does not involve the testing of an intervention (e.g., new drug). Observational studies are used to collect varying kinds of information, such as the prevalence of an infection, cause of an infection, use of particular drugs in clinical settings, the characteristics of affected patients, the care procedures used, and clinical outcomes for normal standard of care. The information gathered is typically used to identify patient populations and suitable sites for trials, and to guide the design of interventional studies, which assess the impact of interventions such as new drugs. Observational studies can be used to generate evidence of the efficacy of treatments, for example through case–control designs (where outcomes in cases are compared with those in matched individuals). Evidence from observational studies is generally not seen as reliable as that from randomised controlled trials.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/observational-study/
46,Clinical,Orphan drug,"A drug developed to treat a rare (“orphan”) disease. Many diseases are so rare that it is not economically viable for companies to invest in the development of new treatments. Collectively, however, orphan diseases are responsible for a significant burden of disease. Regulatory authorities therefore provide incentives to encourage therapy development for orphan diseases. To qualify for orphan drug status, a therapy must be targeted at a condition affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the USA (about six in 10,000 people) or not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU. New antibiotics and other anti-infectives targeting rare but important infections can be granted orphan drug status (e.g. treatment of prosthetic joint infections, or treatment of lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis).",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/orphan-drug/
47,Clinical,Pandrug-resistant (PDR),"Non-susceptibility to all agents in all antimicrobial categories (i.e. bacterial isolates are not susceptible to any clinically available drug). The prevalence of PDR bacteria is difficult to judge as isolates are rarely assessed against all possible antibiotics. However, PDR Gram-negative bacteria have been reported in more than 20 countries in all regions of the world. Mortality in patients infected with these bacteria is high (around 50% on average) but very variable.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/pandrug-resistant/
48,Pre-clinical,Pharmacodynamics (PD),"Study of the uptake, movement, binding and interactions of drugs in the body and how they affect drug activity. Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. Any factor affecting drug concentration at its target site, strength of binding or duration of binding will affect that drug’s pharmacological activity and clinical responses. Broadly speaking, pharmacodynamics considers the properties of a drug that affect target engagement in the body, while pharmacokinetics considers the effect of the body on a drug.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/pharmacodynamics-pd/
49,Pre-clinical,Pharmacokinetics (PK),"Study of the body’s handling and metabolism of drugs in the body, including their absorption, distribution between different tissues, localization within tissues, modification and excretion (see: ‘ADME‘). Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. If the body does not absorb a drug, modifies it chemically, or rapidly excretes it, the drug will be less able to bind to its target site and have a biological effect. Broadly speaking, pharmacokinetics considers the effect of the body on a drug, while pharmacodynamics considers the properties of a drug that affect target engagement in the body. Population PK modelling takes account of variation in how drugs are metabolized by different people within a population. This requires more sophisticated statistical methodologies but provides results more relevant to individuals. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models are more closely based on human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry. They are complex multi-component models that more accurately reflect human biology but are also more challenging to develop.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/pharmacokinetics-pk/
50,Pre-clinical,Pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK/PD),"Integration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to understand how a drug is likely to be distributed through the body over time and the access it will have to its molecular target. This understanding provides the basis for dosing strategies. Typically, PK/PD modelling is used to simulate how a drug is distributed across different tissues (or ‘compartments’) over time. These models can be used to estimate drug concentrations at different body sites for different dosing regimens and drug effect.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics-pk-pd/
51,Clinical,Pharmacovigilance,"Clinical trials are used to assess the safety of new medicines. Pharmacovigilance is the process of collecting safety data after the drug has been approved for use and giving this information to the regulatory authorities. The data collected includes adverse effects associated with use of a drug. Pharmacovigilance is required after marketing approval to detect potential adverse reactions that could be due to use of the medicine. In particular, it can detect rare side effects that are not picked up during clinical trials or affect specific groups of individuals. A phase 4 clinical trial investigates the occurrence of side effects over time by a new treatment after it has been approved and is on the market.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/pharmacovigilance/
52,Clinical,"Phase 1, 2, 3, 4 trials","Different stages of clinical testing of a new drug. Phase 1: First testing in humans, primarily to test safety. A drug is given to a small number of healthy volunteers who are closely monitored. Phase 2: Testing in a small number of patients, to assess safety, to monitor how a drug is metabolized, and to gather initial data on efficacy. Phase 3: A large trial in patients to test efficacy and safety. Pivotal phase 3 trials (or registration trials) provide the key data on efficacy in submissions for regulatory approval. Phase 4: Studies undertaken after a drug has been licensed, to gather further safety, efficacy or effectiveness data in routine clinical use. Phase 2 studies are sometimes divided into phase 2A and 2B. There are no formal definitions of these divisions, but phase 2A studies are typically more preliminary and can address issues such as dosing and safety, while phase 2B studies are generally ‘mini-phase 3’ studies that provide data on efficacy. Increasingly, these categories are becoming less clear-cut, particularly phase 2 and 3 trials.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/phase-1234-trials/
53,Clinical,Pneumonia,"An infection of the lungs where the air sacs (alveoli) fill with fluid and pus making breathing difficult. Bacterial pneumonia can follow from an infection by respiratory viruses such as influenza. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) affects people outside hospital. Pneumonia can also occur in patients while in hospital (hospital-acquired pneumonia, HAP), particularly when patients are on mechanical ventilation (ventilator-associated pneumonia, VAP). Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses and fungi. The organisms causing bacterial community-acquired pneumonia are usually different to those responsible for hospital-acquired pneumonia.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/pneumonia/
54,Clinical,Power (clinical trials),"The probability of detecting a true effect in an experimental study. Clinical trials involve a subset of a population of interest. Results are then extrapolated to the population of a whole. However, this raises the risk that the effects seen in the trial are not representative of those that would be seen in the whole population. This risk is greatest when sample sizes are small. Power analysis is used to provide a measure of confidence in results and to ensure the statistical validity of extrapolation to larger populations. Power analysis is a key element of study design, particularly to identify appropriate sample sizes (in clinical trials, how many people need to be recruited). As recruitment can be challenging, there is an incentive to minimize the number of participants in a study. However, with small numbers, it can be difficult to be confident that observed effects provide a reliable indication of an intervention’s effects. A second key factor affecting the power of a study and sample sizes is the effect size that indicates a clinically meaningful change and can be used to judge whether an intervention has demonstrated efficacy. Detecting a small change will require large numbers of participants to provide good statistical confidence. Power analyses are used to provide an estimate of the likelihood (expressed as a percentage) that a particular effect size will be seen for a particular sample size. In practice, preferred likelihoods and effect sizes are selected in order to identify appropriate sample sizes (e.g. a 95% probability of detecting a 20% decrease in an outcome measure of interest). If a study includes too few participants for statistically robust conclusions to be drawn, it is described as underpowered.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/power-clinical-trials/
55,Pre-clinical,Preclinical development,"The preclinical phase of drug development refers to testing of activity and toxicity of a drug candidate in in vitro and in vivo studies before testing in patients can be performed. The preclinical development stage begins when a viable candidate for formal preclinical development has been chosen. The programme is informed by guidance documents issued by regulatory agencies and includes CMC, animal toxicology, pharmacological data, and clinical protocols and investigator information. The goal of preclinical development is to submit data for review to the regulatory agencies to approve clinical testing of the drug in humans.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/preclinical-development/
56,Discovery,Pro-drug,"A drug that is administered in an inactive form and is metabolized in the body into a pharmacologically active agent. A pro-drug may be developed if a biologically active compound has poor pharmacokinetic properties, for example if it is not absorbed well or rapidly excreted.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/pro-drug/
57,Clinical,QT study,"A clinical study to assess the potential of a drug to affect heart rhythms. Some drugs, including antibiotics, can lengthen the time it takes for the heart muscles to prepare for contraction, known as prolongation of the QT interval. The QT interval is a measurement made on an electrocardiogram. Because of this risk, regulatory authorities require that drug developers provide evidence of their drug’s impact on the QT interval.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/qt-study/
58,Clinical,Quality assurance (clinical trials),"Measures taken to ensure that a clinical study is conducted and reported according to its agreed protocol, and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and any other relevant regulatory requirements. Quality assurance is based on a planned and systematic set of activities to ensure that all aspects of a clinical trial are carried out to a high standard. These activities are essential to protect the health and wellbeing of participants in trials and to ensure that the data obtained are reliable.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/quality-assurance-clinical-trials/
59,Clinical,Sepsis,"Life-threatening organ failure caused by a dysregulated host response, often to an infection. In informal use, sepsis often refers to a bloodstream bacterial infection (BSI), and the term is sometimes used synonymously with septicaemia. More than 19 million cases of sepsis and 5 million sepsis-related deaths are estimated to occur each year, most of them in low- and middle-income countries. Sepsis causes nearly half a million deaths in the newborn period each year. Globally, antimicrobial resistance contributes to one-third of neonatal sepsis deaths.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/sepsis/
60,Clinical,Serious adverse event (SAE),"Any unfavourable occurrence in a trial participant that has a major impact on their health. All SAEs occurring during a trial must be documented in clinical study reports and whether they are considered related to participation in the trial. Independent investigations are carried out to determine whether the SAE was potentially related to the trial intervention or was a random occurrence. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are those considered likely to have been caused by the study intervention.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/serious-adverse-event-sae/
61,Clinical,Skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI),"Microbial invasion of the layers of the skin and underlying soft tissues. The FDA defines acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) as a bacterial infection of the skin with a lesion size area of at least 75 cm2 (cellulitis, erysipelas, wound infection, major cutaneous abscess). The EMA classification of bacterial skin and soft tissue infection (BSSTI) includes cellulitis, erysipelas, wound infections (traumatic or post-surgical) and major abscesses. Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) are the most severe and involve deeper soft tissue. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of cSSTIs, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) a particular challenge.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/skin-and-soft-tissue-infection-ssti/
62,Discovery,Small molecule,"A chemical/antimicrobial with a mass usually less than 1000 daltons. Small molecules have long been the preferred type of pharmaceutical. Their advantages include relative ease of chemical manufacture, pharmacologic predictability, ability to enter cells and potential for oral use.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/small-molecule/
63,Pre-clinical,Target candidate profile (TCP),"The desired characteristics of a preclinical drug candidate. A TCP covers key features such as antimicrobial activity, specificity, stability and physicochemical properties. It is used during early research and development (R&D) phases to select the best compounds to work on and to guide optimization of chemical structures and properties through medicinal chemistry.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/target-candidate-profile-tcp/
64,Pre-clinical,Target product profile (TPP),"The desired characteristics of a new drug or other medical intervention (such as a diagnostic tool). TPPs include key factors such as nature of infection, age group, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability, stability, route of administration, dosing frequency and cost. They are often developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) or other bodies to provide a global consensus on the requirements of a new drug or medical intervention, to guide research and development (R&D) activities.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/target-product-profile-tpp/
65,Discovery,Target validation,"Confirmation that inhibition of a bacterial target structure or enzymatic activity is likely to be clinically useful. A bacterial target is critical to its survival or multiplication. However, it must be shown in vitro or in animal models that inhibition of the target is pharmacologically possible and impairs microbial growth, that it cannot be readily overcome by adaptation of other microbial pathways, and that has no significant impact on the host. Stage of infection must also be considered. A bacterial protein important in late stages of infection, when the host has already been infected, may be a less promising target than one essential to an early stage of infection.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/target-validation/
66,Clinical,Therapeutic index,"The ratio of the blood concentration at which a drug becomes toxic (TD50) and the concentration at which it is effective (ED50). Dosage of drugs with a low therapeutic index can be challenging, as relatively small increases in drug levels can trigger side effects. Such drugs are said to have a small therapeutic window.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/therapeutic-index/
67,Pre-clinical,Toxicity,"The harmful effects of a drug. Toxicity is one of the most common reasons for a drug to fail during clinical development. Toxicology studies traditionally focused on the effects of a drug in animal models, but increasingly in vitro cellular and biochemical approaches are also being used. To a degree, potential toxicity issues can now also be predicted on the basis of chemical structures (‘in silico toxicology’).",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/toxicity/
68,Clinical,Urinary tract infection (UTI),"An infection in any part of the urinary system (kidney, ureter, bladder or urethra). UTIs, particularly by E. coli in women, are extremely common. Widespread use of antibiotics has led to high levels of drug-resistant bacteria that cause UTIs, many caused by bacteria carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Complicated UTIs (cUTIs) are usually in people with underlying conditions, for example structural or functional abnormalities in the urinary system, other underlying health issues, or the impact of medical interventions such as use of catheters. Most UTIs in older people are cUTIs. cUTIs increase the risk of treatment failure, complications and antibiotic resistance.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/urinary-tract-infection-uti/
69,Clinical,Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP),"A lung infection that develops in a patient who is on a ventilator. VAP is the most common infection acquired in intensive care units and is associated with high mortality. It can be caused by multiple microbes, and the need to treat rapidly leads to use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Treatment is increasingly difficult in many settings due to drug-resistant infections, particularly multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and other ‘ESKAPE’ pathogens. The organisms responsible for VAP are generally different from those causing pneumonia outside the hospital (community-acquired pneumonia).",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/ventilator-associated-pneumonia-vap/
