They are also known as secondary metabolites being non-essential for life, but they play key roles in defence and cell to cell communication. They represent a unique chemical space with compounds distributed in a broad diversity of chemical classes. They have been evolving with nature together with the activities that have been optimized together with the targets. Pharmaceutical companies have been using natural products for decades as one of the major sources for discovery of novel bio-active compounds and today more than 50% of the molecules in development are still natural products, semi-synthetic derivatives or have been inspired in these scaffolds. Today, natural products are still an untapped reservoir with more than 90% of the microbial sources still underexplored and with biosynthetic potential that by far exceeds the initial estimations. This is why natural products still represent one of the major sources of chemical diversity and one of the starting points for the discovery of novel antibiotics.","","","","Natural products","","",,,,,,,

Typically, multiple chemical variants of a hit compound are synthesized (hit expansion).

Chemical modifications are also introduced to improve its drug-like properties, such as stability, membrane permeability, cytotoxicity and specificity.

Further studies are required to understand how they achieve their antibacterial effects. Determining mechanism of action is important because it suggests what modifications could be made to a compound to improve its activity and specificity. In addition, antibiotics used as combinations should ideally have different mechanisms of actions, to make it harder for bacteria to develop resistance to treatment.","","","","Mechanism of action (MoA)","","",,,,,,,

There are no formal definitions of these divisions, but phase 2A studies are typically more preliminary and can address issues such as dosing and safety, while phase 2B studies are generally �mini-phase 3� studies that provide data on efficacy.

The test chemical is applied to a bacterial strain that has a mutation which renders it dependent on histidine for growth, along with a rat liver extract (to explore the potential for enzymatic processing of the chemical into a mutagenic form). After culture, the number of colonies that can grow in the absence of histidine, due to reversion of the mutation, provides a measure of the mutagenic potential of the chemical. There is a reasonable degree of correlation between mutagenicity as judged by the Ames essay and carcinogenicity in animal models.

Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. If the body does not absorb a drug, modifies it chemically, or rapidly excretes it, the drug will be less able to bind to its target site and have a biological effect. Broadly speaking, pharmacokinetics considers the effect of the body on a drug, while pharmacodynamics considers the properties of a drug that affect target engagement in the body. Population PK modelling takes account of variation in how drugs are metabolized by different people within a population. This requires more sophisticated statistical methodologies but provides results more relevant to individuals.

Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer membrane but have a much thicker peptidoglycan layer than Gram-negative organisms. There is no periplasm and enzymes e.g., beta-lactamases are excreted to the outside of the cell. This distinction has important implications for antibiotic development. Many antibiotics target proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis so have to traverse the outer membrane and periplasm in Gram-negative bacteria.
